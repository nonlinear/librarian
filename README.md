## Installation

1. **Clone this repo**
2. **[Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**: 3.11 or higher
3. **Run setup**: `bash ./engine/scripts/setup.sh`
   - Installs dependencies
   - Downloads embedding model: [BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5) (~130MB, 384-dim)
   - Saved in `engine/models/` (git-ignored)
4. **BYOB**: Bring Your Own Books
   - Create folders in `books/` (one per topic)
   - Add `.epub` and `.pdf` files
   - **Optional:** Use subfolders for grouping
     - Example: `books/cybersecurity/strategy/` → `cybersecurity_strategy`
5. **Generate metadata**: `python3.11 engine/scripts/generate_metadata.py`
6. **Build indices**:
   - Full: `python3.11 engine/scripts/indexer.py`
   - Per-topic: `python3.11 engine/scripts/reindex_topic.py <topic-id>`
7. **Test**: `python3.11 engine/scripts/research.py "AI ethics?" --topic ai`

    B --> E[book2.pdf]

    C --> F[book3.epub]
    C --> G[book4.pdf]

    H[topic3/<br/>root books] --> I[book5.epub]
    H --> J[subfolder1/<br/>topic3_subfolder1]
    H --> K[subfolder2/<br/>topic3_subfolder2]

    J --> L[book6.epub]
    K --> M[book7.epub]

## Usage

<!-- ### via [openclaw](https://openclaw.ai)

```bash
clawdhub install librarian
```

### by prompt -->

**Use `/research` prompt** to consult Librarian MCP on your AI conversations (see [.github/prompts/research.prompt.md](.github/prompts/research.prompt.md))

Make sure to **specify topic or book** in your question. MCP will try to disambiguate based on metadata tags but the more focused the search, the better the results

**Example 1**: "`/research` what does Bogdanov say about Mars in Molecular Red?"

**Example 2**: "`/research` in my anthropocene books, what are the main critiques of geoengineering?"

**Example 3**: "`/research` what tarot spreads work best for decision-making under uncertainty?"

**Troubleshooting:** Books that failed to index (corrupted files, unsupported formats) go silently to `backstage/FAILED.md`

> 👉 Without `/research` your AI uses general knowledge. With it you get precise citations from your library

## How it works

```mermaid
graph TD
    QUERY([research prompt+<br>specific book query]) --> MAP[Read metadata.json]
    MAP --> SIM[Semantic Similarity]

    SIM --> T1[Topic: philosophy<br/>Score: 0.89]
    SIM --> T2[Topic: AI<br/>Score: 0.32]

    T1 --> B1[Book: Psychopolitics<br/>Tags: power, discipline<br/>Score: 0.91]

    B1 --> DECISION1{Confident match?}
    T2 --> DECISION2{Confident match?}

    DECISION1 -->|Yes| VEC[Query Vector Store<br/>Scope: philosophy/Psychopolitics]
    DECISION2 -->|No| ASK[System asks for clarification]

    ASK --> CLARIFY[Clarification query]
    CLARIFY --> MAP

    VEC --> ANSWER([Precise answer from<br>relevant book chunks])
```
