# Epic Announcement - Publication Workflow

**When epic is merged to main:**

1. **Document completion** in CHANGELOG.md
2. **Announce publicly** via nonlinear article/blog post:
   - What we built
   - Why it matters
   - How to use it
   - Learnings/insights

**Purpose:**
- Share knowledge with community
- Show progress (portfolio visibility)
- Document journey (not just results)
- Help others solve similar problems

**Article location:** `~/Documents/nonlinear/content/` (or appropriate blog)

**Status:** 🔴 **Template not yet defined**

**Next step:** Create announcement template + publishing workflow

**AI enforcement:**
- After merge to main → remind Nicholas to write announcement
- Check if announcement published within 7 days
- Nudge if not done
