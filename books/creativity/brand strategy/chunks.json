(Um, how dare he\nshare ALL our secrets?!) I hope he’s charging at least a year’s worth of\nschool tuition for this book. Seriously, take copious notes on the practical\nsuggestions offered here to help steer your own career, whether it’s your\nfirst job or your 75th freelance gig. The drama-free work approach and\nleadership style outlined in _Burn Your Portfolio_ is what makes working with\nMike and all the folks at his company, Riser, FUN and worthy of the cupcakes\nwe send to celebrate each of our successes together.”\n\n**—Michelle Sullivan**  \n** _VP Digital, Kids & Family Publishing and Media, National Geographic (aka\n800-pound Gorilla Client)_**\n\n“This book should be a mandatory course at art schools...no, at _all_ schools!\nThe message transcends occupation; it’s about maneuvering through the unspoken\nrules and dynamics of various personalities in your workplace. Mike is a\nperfect person to deliver this message; his long-term relationships and\nsuccess of his business are the true testimony of his skills on managing up,\ndown, and sideways. Your talent alone will take you nowhere if your character\ndoesn’t support it.",

Your talent alone will take you nowhere if your character\ndoesn’t support it. If you want longevity in your field, this book is a must-\nread.”\n\n**—Jane Bhang**  \n** _Consulting Art Director, Sony Pictures Entertainment_**\n\n“I wish I could take every designer I’ve ever worked with and smack them over\nthe head with this book...which would hurt, because it’s big! After that, I’d\ntell them to read it cover to cover, because Michael Janda will show them how\nto stop making the business mistakes nearly everyone in design is making.”\n\n**—Dave Crenshaw  \n _Author of_ The Myth of Multitasking _and_ The Focused Business**\n\n“ _Burn Your Portfolio_ is an enjoyable, substantive gallop through an\ninventive guidebook for designers and programmers who envision themselves with\na thriving business. It should be on every designer’s must-read list. Michael\ndraws in the reader by “showing” rather than merely “telling.” He gives the\nbook a human, personal touch by sprinkling the text with his own adventures.\nAnd though he is primarily speaking to designers, his message about honing\ninterpersonal skills is imperative for ANY enterprise. As a client, that, more\nthan anything, keeps me coming back.”\n\n**—Cheryl Saban, Ph.D.**  \n**_Author of_** **What Is Your Self-Worth? A Woman’s Guide to Validation**\n**_and founder of the Self Worth Foundation_**\n\n“I went to school to learn to be a designer. I went to Mike Janda to learn to\nrun a design business. He is incredible. I’ve never met anyone who literally\nunderstands everything that I’ve ever struggled with since the day I graduated\nfrom school. From freelancing, contracts, and proposals to making the best\nbusiness decisions and standing up to any kind of client, Janda tells you\neverything you need to know. His life lessons are quick, in layman’s terms,\nand so amazingly valuable you will use something he teaches you every single\nday.”\n\n**—Lorilee Rager**  \n** _Owner, Thrive Creative Group, LLC_**\n\n“Do you want to supercharge your design career? Drop that Wacom pen and\nimmediately pick up _Burn Your Portfolio_ , and read it cover to cover.\nMichael Janda clearly outlines practical, actionable advice that will make\nyour design business better, your clients happier, and your teams more\nproductive. Even if you’re a freelancer just striking out on your own—no,\nespecially if you are—the insights, truisms, and humor in this book will prove\nto be valuable tools in your design arsenal.”\n\n**—Marc Siry**  \n** _SVP, Media Products, NBC Universal_**\n\n“This one’s on fire! _Burn Your Portfolio_ is hands-down the most\nentertaining, helpful, and hilarious insider’s guide for creative\nprofessionals out there. Janda is an absolute genius when it comes to managing\nclient expectations, creating production processes that actually work, and\nrunning a thriving and vibrant design business. He and I used to work together\nat Fox—I owe much of my own success to his brilliant and zany methods.”\n\n**—Allison Ellis**  \n** _Owner, Hopscotch Consulting_**\n\n“Michael Janda is the one person you want to listen to when it comes to advice\nabout succeeding in a creative field! He has more creative talent, street\nsmarts, and people skills than anyone I have ever met. What this book presents\nthe reader with is an inside-track to those secrets in an appetizing\ncollection of goodness!”\n\n**—Jeff Jolley**  \n** _President, Riser_**\n\n“The starving artist cliché has never been in greater danger.",

Creatives...READ THIS BOOK!”\n\n**—Mark Long**  \n** _Founder, RetouchUp/Hollywood FotoFix Studios_**\n\n“I’ve worked with Michael and Riser for many years, and the thing that\ndifferentiates Michael and his team from other agencies is their ability to\nspeak my language versus design speak! Michael and his company Riser are not\nonly super-creative, they are total professionals. Communication is a big\nreason why Michael and his team are so successful at what they do. They are\ngood at not only listening to a client who is not a designer and is trying to\nconvey the details of a project, but also on working with the client to get\nthe job done well, on time, and also on budget. I can’t think of a better\nperson to give advice to designers who need to work with clients in the real\nworld.”\n\n**—Melissa Van Meter**  \n** _VP, Marketing & Advertising, TV Guide Network_**\n\n“Wow! Mike Janda has delivered truly invaluable insight and real-world tips on\nhow to be a rock star in the creative industry. He describes genuine\nexperiences and conveys practical know-how—beyond what any web browser or art\nschool could offer. With memorable detail and a sassy tone, this book will\ncontinue to inspire you for a lifetime.”\n\n**—Lynda Hodge**  \n** _Freelance Graphic Designer_**\n\n“Mike Janda knows that a successful career isn’t built on talent alone; that\nit takes certain skills to actually stay in business. With this book he shares\nthe fruit of his experience in a fun, concise, and memorable way.”\n\n**—Lawrence Terenzi**  \n** _Director, Product Development, Crackle_**\n\n“It takes more than just mad skills and skinny jeans to thrive in this\nindustry. Finally, a book for creatives with tangible and proven ways to be a\nsuccessful designer. After 13 years of professional design, this book makes me\nfeel like a newb; I am recommending it to all of my designers and developers.”\n\n**—Josh Child**  \n** _Vice President, Creative, Riser_**\n\n“As a design professional with over 16 years of experience in the industry, I\ncan speak to the importance and wisdom of the principles addressed in this\nbook. Not only do they help designers early in their careers but they also\napply to those who have been in the industry for many years.\n\nThere is a lot more to being a creative professional than simply having\ntalent. This book will help you make an honest assessment of your abilities\nand discover areas that need improvement. As you implement the things Michael\ntalks about in the book, you will find that your creativity and problem\nsolving will strengthen a lot just by improving some of your non-design–based\nskills such as client communication, business strategy, and work ethic. All of\nthese things are connected. I learned a lot about myself during this process\nand have been able to create a game plan that has helped me connect better\nwith my clients and employees.\n\nI have always had a great deal of respect for Mike Janda as a seasoned\ncreative, strategic thinker, and successful business owner. After reading this\nbook and hearing him speak about the things he’s learned throughout his\ncareer, my respect and admiration have only increased. I recommend this book\nto any creative professional regardless of medium of expertise or level of\nexperience.”\n\n**—John Thomas**  \n** _Principal/Creative Director, Blue Tractor Design Company_**\n\n“This is much more than a book; it is a survival kit for creative\nprofessionals.",

I’ve seen his company grow from a\nsmall mom-and-pop web agency to a full-fledged industry-leading agency. I can\nstill remember the first time I met Mike when he was our creative director,\nand I was a fresh-out-of-college intern. My boss at the time sent me to\nretrieve a booklet from Mike. To this day, I can still remember my\nconversation with him. He treated me with the utmost respect and sincerity. He\ndidn’t have to be nice to me, but he was. And he most certainly didn’t treat\nme well based on my job title. And that is why I believe Mike has all the\nqualities that all bosses should emulate. He is honest, smart, responsible,\nand most importantly, conducts business with a smile. In such a fast moving\nindustry, it’s hard to find people you trust—but I’ve always trusted that Mike\nhas had my best interest in mind. It’s not a trade secret to be nice, and you\ncan’t buy or download that in an app!”\n\n**—Thuy (Twee) Tran**  \n** _Senior Content Producer, ABC Family_**\n\n“My introduction to Mike occurred as he interviewed me for a job. He\nimmediately proceeded to deconstruct my portfolio and find the nuggets of\ntalent contained in it (small), and then on the fly proceeded to help me\nformulate my pitch to him. Somehow I still got the job. From Mike I learned\neverything I know about beating the procrastination monster, along with so\nmany other useful things, all skills I use to this day. And fortunately for\nthe rest of the design world, Mike has put all of these tips into a designer’s\nguide to getting along in the real world, with all his humor and insight\nintact.”\n\n**—Ray Woods II**  \n** _Director, User Experience, NBC Universal_**\n\n\n_This book is dedicated to my family,  \nJodi, Max, Mason, and Miles.  \nThank you for your amazing support  \nand allowing me to chase my dreams.  \nI love you more than my Jeep  \nand the Chicago Bears, combined._\n\n![Image](../images/00003.jpeg)\n\n\n## Contents\n\n**Introduction**\n\n[Burn Your Portfolio...Really?",

I knew my destiny would\nland me at a hoity-toity agency where I would be a star designer, dazzling\nclients on high-profile campaigns for the most recognized brands in the world.\n\nOne tearful month later, after the humbling task of job hunting—applying to\nagencies, getting a few interviews, and landing nowhere—I accepted my first\njob in the industry: prepress coordinator for the local AlphaGraphics copy\ncenter. At nine dollars per hour, I was the star designer all right. Nobody\ncould center text on a perforated sheet of business cards and feed them into a\nphotocopier better than me.\n\nWith a Midwest work ethic and a motto of “OCD Is an Attribute,” it took me\nfour short years to progress from my illustrious copy center job to a senior\ncreative director position at Fox Studios. At Fox, I managed the design,\ndevelopment, and editorial elements of the Fox Kids and Fox Family websites.\n\nThe dot bomb and the dismantling of our division at Fox launched me into a\nfour-year freelance stint that would provide me with an income level well\nbeyond any expectations I had upon finishing my college degree and that\nafforded me all of my “wants” as well as my “needs.” When the freelance load\nbecame too much to handle on my own, my wife forced me to hire people.\nSeventeen salaried employees later and over a decade of history, my acclaimed\nagency, Riser, boasts clients like Google, Disney, NBC, National Geographic,\nand Warner Bros.\n\nI have been privileged to interview, manage, and hire hundreds of designers\nand programmers throughout the course of my career. One thing I know for\ncertain is that your graphic design portfolio is a critical element to get you\nin the door of prospective employers and clients. Design schools know it and\nspend 90 percent of their efforts teaching students the skills they need to\nput together an awesome portfolio prior to graduation.\n\nThe other thing I know for certain is that, while a design school spends 90\npercent of their effort making students capable of creating a killer\nportfolio, once you’re in the door your portfolio is not 90 percent of what\nwill make you actually successful in a creative career. In fact, it isn’t even\nclose to the only thing that will lead you to success.\n\nTeamwork, client skills, communication, social aptitude, production speed, and\nbusiness savvy all play a GIGANTIC part in what will make you successful as a\ngraphic designer, whether your aspirations include freelancing, working for an\nagency, or managing your own firm. This book is dedicated to teaching those\ntypes of skills...the stuff they don’t teach you in design school, but should.\n\nBurn your portfolio? OK, so maybe that statement is a tad extreme. However,\nthe lessons I’ve learned that are contained in this book are every bit as\ncritical as your ability to create award-winning design. Learn them. Apply\nthem. Couple these techniques with your killer portfolio, and find a new level\nof success in the real business of graphic design.",

A few of these require\nmentioning here.\n\nFirst and foremost to my wife, Jodi, your undying support of my addiction to\nambition has not gone unnoticed. In the brief moments that you have not been\nconsulting with me on every aspect of my professional life, you have been\nmanaging our family, allowing me the freedom to achieve my successes in life.\nI would not be who I am without you. “Thank you” is an understatement. I love\nyou.\n\nTo my parents, Dennis and Nancy, thank you for teaching me good principles,\ninstilling in me an expectation of success, and encouraging me to do something\nI love for a living.\n\nMy in-laws, Gary and Connie Allen, you both have taught me life lessons that\nare referenced in the book. Thank you for supporting me as “one of your own.”\n\nAlan Rogers, in my early twenties I learned to be a leader, teacher, and\nmanager under your great example and tutelage. Much of my success has come\nfrom the foundation you helped me establish.\n\nSara Robbins, my high school art teacher, you made art so much fun I chose it\nas a career.\n\nSeveral coworkers (past and present), family members, and forever friends\nrequire mention. Jeff Jolley, Rachel Allen, Kris Kristensen, Marc Siry, Ray\nWoods, Thuy Tran, Grandpa Zwick, Eric Lee, Darrell Goff, Derek Ellis, John\nThomas, Josh Child, and Mark Long: You drive me and inspire me to much greater\nheights.\n\nAnd to all the Janda Design Company, Jandaco, Riser Media, and Riser employees\npast, present, and future: Thank you for enduring the rough times when we had\nyet to solve all the challenges that faced our growing company. Sorry for the\ntimes we weren’t perfect...I was always striving with good intentions.\n\nNick Jarvis, thank you for the wicked illustrations and collaboration on the\ndesign of the book. You are a rare talent.\n\nJennah Mitchell, thank you for the first round of edits. You drove this book\nin a better direction.\n\nJan Seymour, the development and copy editor on this book, you are amazing.\nYou epitomize the “OCD Is an Attribute” principle.\n\nFinally, to the rest of the team at Peachpit Press and Nikki McDonald, thank\nyou for believing in this book and convincing me not to name it “Polishing\nTurds.” :-)\n\n\n# Section 1: Human Engineering\n\nBEHAVIOR, WORK ETHIC, AND SOCIAL PROWESS HAVE AS MUCH TO DO WITH YOUR SUCCESS\nAS YOUR ABILITY TO BEAT PHOTOSHOP SENSELESSLY INTO SUBMISSION.\n\n\n## 1\\. The Big Fat Secret\n\nAsk anyone who I’ve worked with over the course of my career and they’ll all\nprobably say the same thing: “Michael Janda is absolutely, without question,\none of the most talented creators of mediocre graphic design work the world\nhas ever seen.” To which I would wholeheartedly agree.\n\nWhen it comes to design, I’m all right. I am definitely above average, but I\nknow many designers who can design circles around me (fortunately, I employ\nsome of them). However, I don’t know many designers who have had the good\nfortune of finding the level of “success” in their career that I have been\nblessed to achieve. Why do some amazing designers struggle to accomplish great\nthings and other mediocre designers find great success? Hard work? Being in\nthe right place at the right time? Sheer blind luck?\n\nThe truth is that in the graphic design industry (and nearly every other\noccupation out there), your creative design and technical skills account for\nonly a fraction of your value to a client or to an employer. I have no doubt\nthat it is your interpersonal skills that get you that success. One of my\nfavorite books of all time is Dale Carnegie’s 1936 masterpiece, _How to Win\nFriends & Influence People_, and it is my heartfelt belief that this book\nshould be required reading for everyone in the world. Many of you have likely\nread this gem; I have myself purchased, read, and gifted this book countless\ntimes.\n\nThe book’s introductory material explains the purpose for which it was written\nbased on research conducted by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of\nTeaching as well as the Carnegie Institute of Technology.

Many of you have likely\nread this gem; I have myself purchased, read, and gifted this book countless\ntimes.\n\nThe book’s introductory material explains the purpose for which it was written\nbased on research conducted by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of\nTeaching as well as the Carnegie Institute of Technology. Following Mr.\nCarnegie’s quote in which he believes that only 15 percent of financial\nsuccess is due to technical knowledge, while 85 percent is due to personal\nskills and an ability to lead people, he continues a few paragraphs later with\nthe following principles: The person headed for higher earning potential is\nthe one who not only has the technical knowledge but who can express ideas,\nlead people, and develop enthusiasm in those people.\n\nHe continues by noting John D. Rockefeller’s famous quote that states that the\nability to deal with people is a purchasable commodity equal to sugar or\ncoffee, and that he himself would pay more for that ability than all others.\nWith this, Mr. Carnegie would imagine this to be a critical topic to be taught\nin college. But as he points out, he has never seen a college course such as\nthis in all the land.\n\nI’ve already admitted that my design skills are far from otherworldly. And I\nwould not be so arrogant as to say that I am a master people manager (plenty\nof my ex-coworkers would quickly agree on this point). But I do openly posit\nthat my success as a graphic designer has more to do with my ability to get\nalong with others—bosses, clients, employees, and teammates—than it has to do\nwith my design and technical abilities.\n\nThis can also be seen in the way I’ve put together the team at my agency,\ncomprised of hand-picked, quality individuals that I know contribute to our\nsuccess. As I think about the current team, based on Mr. Carnegie’s research\nit is no surprise to me that the person with the largest salary is not a\ndesigner, not a programmer, and not even a project manager. Rather, the person\nlinked to the highest monetary value is my right-hand man who currently serves\nas “president” of the company. Perhaps, though, a more apt title for him would\nbe that of “Head Schmoozer.”\n\nHe is the one who walks the tightrope of communication between our clients and\nour employees. He is absolutely indispensable; our clients love him and our\nteam respects him. He doesn’t own one share of stock in our company but I\nopenly share company profits with him. Even though he couldn’t design his way\nout of his own garage, he is a great people person—and that translates to\ngreat company interaction with our clients and to the resulting great end\nproducts. So it follows from Mr. Carnegie’s research, these interpersonal\nskills are critical to success not only for myself as agency owner but for\nthose coworkers surrounding me.\n\nThis book is not the platform for sharing all the secrets to managing and\nrelating to people. There is plenty of information out there on the subject\nthat comes from people much more qualified than I. The format of this book is,\nhowever, the appropriate place for me to say that I believe your finely tuned\ngraphic design skills will get you only 15 percent of the way to success in\nyour career, rather than the 90 percent of the way that the design schools\nlead you to believe. Begin working on your people skills today to ensure that\nyou achieve your full measure of success.\n\nUltimately, I believe that if you want to succeed in your career as a graphic\ndesigner, you need to focus time and energy into developing your interpersonal\nskills. The more you can get in tune with the needs of your clients, bosses,\nand team members, the better off you will be. People will rave about your\nstellar service, and you will begin to enjoy the fruits that come from the\ntree of hard work and jobs well done.",

The Extra Mile\n\nWhen my career was still in its infancy—a mere two years old—I was privileged\nto experience firsthand how the act of exceeding the expectations of your\nemployers can greatly advance your career. The year was 1998, and a children’s\ntoy, game, and book publishing company located in Phoenix hired me to create a\nnew corporate website.\n\nThe dot-com era was heating up and our nation had never seen excitement around\nan opportunity like the Internet since the California Gold Rush 150 years\nearlier. The ambitious CEO who employed me had a grand vision of what his\nmaiden online voyage could become. He envisioned users coming to his site and\nfinding a bookshelf loaded with books. The user would click a book, turn the\npages to sample it, and then be able to buy it right off of the virtual shelf.\n\nFortunately for me, I had invested considerable personal time learning an\nearly version of Flash and had experience with some 3D modeling software. I\nsuppose the competition for the job was light due to the newness of the\ntechnologies, but I was certainly grateful to land the opportunity.\n\nGoing the extra mile was second nature to me, as I seemed to have been born\nwith a deep-rooted desire to please others. From day one I began to build more\nthan the CEO had asked. He wanted a bookshelf—I 3D-modeled the inside of a\nvirtual store with a bookshelf in it. Then I imported the 3D assets into Flash\nand “programmed” some interactivity (at the time, Flash allowed only some\nbasic functionality by using drop-down menus).\n\nAfter the room loaded, the user could click the bookshelf, which would load a\nzoomed-in view. In the zoomed-in view, the user could click a book spine; the\nbook would then fall from the shelf and open to display the sample pages. The\n3D store also contained some little interactive elements that engaged the\nuser. When the user clicked a sign, a ball bounced across the screen. When the\nuser moved their mouse over certain items, a tiger from one of the books\npopped out of the side of the screen with a word bubble prompting the user\nwith what to do next.\n\nI also signed up for a rudimentary shopping cart system and loaded it into an\nHTML frame so that when the user clicked something, they could buy from the\nsite. All in all, it was pretty rough by today’s standards, but at the time\nnobody else was doing anything like this.\n\nNeedless to say, the CEO was blown away at the expected bookshelf becoming a\nvirtual store. After promptly giving me a raise, he talked about adding\nanother feature to the store: a room where the user could go to learn about\nthe company. I got to work. At first I added a door to the virtual store. The\nuser would mouse over the door and it would open. When they clicked the door,\nit would load the new room where they could learn about the company. But I\nknew if I wanted to continue impressing my new boss, I needed to exceed his\nexpectations. I 3D-modeled the outside of the virtual store, so that when the\nsite loaded, the user was presented with the front of the virtual store—it was\na quirky, brick building that was sure to capture the interest of their target\naudience.",

I 3D-modeled the outside of the virtual store, so that when the\nsite loaded, the user was presented with the front of the virtual store—it was\na quirky, brick building that was sure to capture the interest of their target\naudience.\n\nWhen I unveiled this to the CEO, he was again amazed at what I was building.\nHe expected an additional room—I gave him an entire building. This time he\nasked me to hire someone else and to add more rooms to the virtual store. I\nfound a very talented person and our little team began working on a town (of\ncourse, the CEO was expecting only more rooms). When he told us to add more\nbuildings to the town, we created a world with different climate zones\n(arctic, jungle, tropics, and so forth). He asked for more climate zones—we\nbegan adding to the galaxy.\n\nOver the course of the next year and a half of exceeding the CEO’s\nexpectations, I had amassed a team of approximately a dozen employees\ndedicated to the creation of [oKID.com](http://oKID.com), The Online Kid Site.\nIt was one of the first virtual worlds on the Internet. oKID World now\ncontained online games, cartoons, educational content, sponsorship\nopportunities, an online club, and of course, an e-commerce section (the\noriginal intent for building this world). The oKID cast of characters was a\nunique group of kids whose names all started with the letter “O”. Owen,\nOlivia, Oscar, Orchid, and O-dude were just a few of the colorful characters\nwe created.\n\nEvery morning around 7:30 A.M., I would get a call from the CEO to walk him\nthrough the new things on the site. Our team had self-imposed daily launches,\nall with the goal of exceeding his expectations. The CEO was parading the site\naround to interested parties and bringing millions of dollars of investor\ncapital into his company. I had nearly doubled my salary in less than two\nyears, and was gaining the experience and a portfolio piece that would shape\nmy professional future.\n\nWith every client and every project, the best graphic designers regularly and\npurposefully exceed their clients’ expectations. If the client expects two\ncomps, send three. If your boss needs something at 3:00 P.M., have it ready at\n2:00 P.M. Always try to be one step ahead of their needs and work to exceed\nexpectations every chance you get.\n\n![Image](../images/00005.jpeg)",

Soak Up Advice\n\nThe graphic design industry is filled with critiques and advice. I realize\nthat I may be in the minority of people who actually thrives in this type of\nenvironment. I can barely design for fifteen minutes without asking for\nsomeone’s opinion, and I can’t remember a time in my career when I didn’t have\nmy nose in a self-help book searching for advice from people who have walked\nlife’s paths before me. Perhaps the fact that you are reading this book puts\nyou in the minority of those who are actively searching for ways to improve.\nOr, maybe you are reading this book because your boss or teacher put a copy of\nit in your hands. Either way, I am glad you picked it up and started reading.\n\nI often tell people that in college I learned how to learn. But I didn’t\nreally learn the skills and attributes I needed to succeed until I had\ngraduated and started my career. I never had a mentor, and I have spent more\nof my career managing than I have spent having people manage me. Most of what\nI know has come from independent study, as well as times of trial and error.\nMy hope is that by soaking up the advice in this book you can avoid some of\nthe pitfalls I have endured, and find increased success in your career.\n\nOver the years, as I have scoured books on design and business strategy, I\nhave found that most books contain as many gems of advice as they do\nunreasonable duds. As you read this book, I invite you to apply what\nreasonably works for you and disregard what doesn’t. These are merely the\nstrategies, philosophies, and experiences that have led me to find success in\nmy career as a graphic designer.\n\n![Image](../images/00006.jpeg)",

Either way, there is something about right-brained people\nthat reads like a prescription drug bottle: “Caution: Do not mix with\nsleeplessness, constructive criticism, subpar coffee, or well-meaning advice.”\nIn order to succeed in the design industry, however, it is imperative that you\nremember that you are not merely the sum of your work. If you interpret design\ncritique as a character critique, you are setting yourself up in a defensive\nposition that will impede your ability to improve your design skills and adapt\nto different creative environments.\n\nSome time ago I walked past one of our designer’s desks and glanced at the\ndesign she was working on. It was pretty rough and headed down the wrong path.\nI knew this designer was a little sensitive, so I tried to choose my words\ncarefully. “So, you’re getting started on X project? Be sure to review the\nexample designs the client sent over that illustrate what they are hoping to\nachieve.” That was all I said. I walked away, confident that I had handled the\nexchange tastefully. Later that day, a few of my employees who sat near her\ntold me that after I left she went into the restroom and sobbed. She didn’t\njust “cry,” she “sobbed.”\n\nI wish that she had taken what I meant as a gentle nudge in a better direction\nas a good thing rather than a bad thing. If I did not know without a doubt\nthat she was a skilled and capable designer, I would not have hired her in the\nfirst place!\n\nIn order to grow in your design skills, you have to hunger for critique and\nadvice from wherever you can get it. Feedback is critical when it comes to\nbeing able to push your design to higher levels. If a colleague were to say to\nyou, “Why don’t you try reducing the size of the logo a little bit,” you\nshouldn’t interpret it as them saying to you, “You call yourself a designer?\nYou suck, you’re ugly, you smell like the back of a 747, and your momma wears\ncombat boots!” You have to realize that your work does not define you as a\nperson and find it inside yourself to say, “Thank you. That is a great\nsuggestion. I’ll give it a try and see how it looks.” Then you must work to\ntruly feel grateful that your design is being pushed and that your colleague\nfelt comfortable enough with you to be able to offer caring, professional\nadvice to help you look better in the long run.\n\nGive the feedback you receive a try; if the new work looks better, keep it. If\nit doesn’t, then go back to what you had. One of the keys to growing in your\nskills is to learn not only to welcome feedback but to desire it from anyone\nwho will give it to you. The greatest designers surround themselves with\npeople whom they trust both as individuals and as creative advisors.\n\n![Image](../images/00007.jpeg)\n\n\n## 5\\. Be Nice to Everyone\n\nWe’ve all heard the Golden Rule, which essentially states: “Treat others how\nyou want to be treated.” Throughout generations and across the globe, numerous\nreligions and philosophers have echoed this universally acclaimed sentiment.\n\n**Christianity**\n\n_“Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye\neven so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.”_\n\n_—Matthew 7:12_\n\n**Confucianism**\n\n_“Never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself.”_\n\n_—Confucius Analects XV.24, tr.",

Being nice to\neveryone has always seemed a simple task. Los Angeles is notorious for abrupt\nexchanges. People seem always to be in a rush...no time for chit-chat. My wife\nand I decided that the fast-paced lifestyle, cost of living, and horrendous\ntraffic has caused this cultural issue in L.A., but I am proud to say that I\nnever gave in to it. Years ago while serving as creative director at\n[FoxKids.com](http://FoxKids.com), I received a knock at my door. In poked the\nhead of Thuy, an intern in our marketing department who was finishing up her\nschooling at UCLA. She had been sent to my office by her boss to pick up some\nstyle guides.\n\nJust being myself, I decided to chat with her for a few minutes. During my\nbrief interrogation, I asked how school was going, how she was enjoying her\ninternship, and other friendly but light conversation. After this experience,\nI assume that we passed in the hall a few times but I have no recollection of\nany other conversations.\n\nI didn’t think much of this experience until many years later after Thuy had\nbecome one of my first “big-time” clients. You see, after Thuy finished her\ninternship, she landed a job at ABC Family. This was right around the same\ntime that I started my own business. While at ABC Family, she sent project\nafter project to our company. I eventually had to hire several people just to\nsupport the load. I added it up once and realized that in a four-year stretch\nof time, Thuy had been responsible for sending over $1 million dollars of\nbusiness to my company. One day we were having lunch together and she said,\n“Hey MJ, you know why I’m such an advocate for you, don’t you?” I responded,\n“No, but I sure appreciate it.” She said, “Do you remember that day at Fox\nthat I came to your office to get some style guides?” I replied, “Yeah.” She\nfinished by simply saying, “You were nice to me and talked to me.”\n\n![Image](../images/00008.jpeg)\n\nTo this day I still have close ties with Thuy, and I have had the privilege of\nreturning a fraction of those favors by providing recommendations for her for\nemployment opportunities. That day that she came to my office and I was “nice\nto her” planted the seed for a business relationship that would far exceed my\nwildest dreams or expectations.\n\nI belong to a business organization called Corporate Alliance.

Drama Is for Soap Operas\n\nI admit it. During the summer of my fourteenth year, my older brother and I\nwatched “Days of Our Lives.” The dramatic story of Bo and Hope, the conniving\nViktor Kiriakis—it was all too much to deny. There were gang wars, love\nstories, and everything in between. The soap opera drama provided an\nentertaining release from real life. Unfortunately, too many people take that\nlevel of dramatics into the work place. This can be a relationship killer.\n\nSome time ago, we met a client for lunch who began talking about another\nagency he uses. He compared our agency to this other group and said that he\nappreciated that we were a “No Drama” firm while the other group, on the other\nhand, was the “Drama” firm. As an example he gave, if there happened to be a\ntext change needed on one of his websites, he would call the other firm and\nthey would immediately have a disproportionate response to the situation, such\nas, “You need a text change? Let me get a conference call set up so we can\ntalk about it. We’ll need myself, three programmers, the company president,\nand our office manager on the call to discuss the logistics of changing that\ntext. How does 3:00 P.M. work for you?”\n\n![Image](../images/00010.jpeg)\n\nWhile soap-star–worthy reactions may be fun at home and with friends, they are\nneither respected nor tolerated in the real world. Here are some ways to keep\ndrama at bay in your dealings with others in the workplace:\n\n• Take a break when you feel like being dramatic. Oftentimes things fall into\nperspective after you’ve stepped away and looked at them later with a\nrefreshed set of eyes.\n\n• Have someone read your dramatic email before you send it. I rewrite and\nrewrite and rewrite emails to make sure the tone is just right. The last thing\nyou want is to have your client read between the lines and get the wrong\nmessage.\n\n• Have only the appropriate people on the call or in the meeting. You don’t\nneed to fill a room with people to discuss a simple tweak to the copy.\n\n• Use a coworker to get things off your chest instead of venting in a lengthy\nemail dissertation. When a client is getting dramatic, it is frequently\nhelpful to complain, blow up, or freak out to your coworker first. This will\nhelp you calm down and then prepare a proportionate response.\n\nWhen you feel yourself slipping into drama-queen mode, take a deep breath,\ncount to ten, drink a pot of coffee—whatever it takes to get your mind back\ninto focus and to stop reacting in a dramatized and often inappropriate\nfashion.\n\n![Image](../images/00011.jpeg)",

This monthly\npowwow is mostly just a chance to get to know other businesses in the area;\nmany of the people who attend are people whom I know from other business\ncircles as well. In this particular event, I had an epiphany as I looked\naround the table during lunch: I was surrounded by friends. This group had\nmoved past being a networking group for me; it was now a luncheon with 30\nclose friends. I have individual relationships with each one of these people.\nMany of them actively refer business to my company, and I actively refer\nbusiness to many of their companies. This is like an army of free salespeople\nout there promoting my business. It was at this moment that I realized that\nyour friends will willingly and freely market your business, so it would serve\nyou well to make a lot of friends.\n\nMy business was founded on relationships. In the early days of my company, a\nfew ex-coworkers who had landed at new companies began sending work to me\nbecause I was a friend.\n\nOne of our company missions is to “turn our clients into friends.” Over the\nyears I’ve had clients\n\n• Use me as a reference on their resumes\n\n• Ask me for letters of recommendation\n\n• Ask me to help them find new jobs\n\n• Ask for advice on how to handle difficult situations inside their business\n\n• Close the door to their office during a meeting and then unload all the\ndrama going on at their business\n\n• Say to me, “You’re like a brother to me.”\n\nIf telling me “You’re like a brother to me” isn’t evidence of a friendship,\nthen I don’t know what is. Here are a few strategies to help you build up your\npool of friends and begin harnessing the power of positive and lasting\nrelationships within your company:\n\n• Get involved in industry groups (AIGA, technology groups)\n\n• Seek out networking groups in your area (many are free)\n\n• Join your local Chamber of Commerce and other business organizations\n\n• Get involved in online networking using LinkedIn, Facebook, and other social\nmedia tools\n\n• Ask people to lunch\n\n• Invite a contact to a sporting event\n\n• Get a few acquaintances together and hit the links\n\nAlso, get involved in as many business circles as is reasonable for your time\nand location (the more the better). Work at forging relationships with\nbusiness contacts in nonbusiness settings, as this is where people generally\nput their guard down and true friendships can begin to flourish. Remember,\nthough, that sincerity is critical. People can tell the difference between\nsincerity in your desire to build a friendship and you just trying to milk\nthem for business.\n\n* * *\n\nYOUR FRIENDS WILL\n\nWILLINGLY AND FREELY\n\nMARKET YOUR BUSINESS,\n\nSO IT WOULD SERVE YOU\n\nWELL TO MAKE\n\nA LOT OF FRIENDS.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 8\\. Gripes Go Up\n\nMy mother-in-law is one of the most positive people I know. When the sun is\nshining she says things like, “Isn’t this the most beautiful day you have ever\nseen?” When it is pouring rain she shares comments like, “Have you ever seen a\nmore beautiful rainstorm?” I teased her about this once, and she said simply,\n“That’s just how I feel.” Indeed, everyone who knows my mother-in-law would\nagree that her positivity is infectious and contagious.\n\nAs easily as positivity breeds positivity, negativity also breeds negativity.\nI’m not sure why, but the graphic design industry seems to have more than its\nfair share of grumpy workers. Perhaps the constant stress of pending deadlines\nencourages frustration. Or maybe it is due to the never-ending stream of\ncritiques that causes designers to become negative in their view of life. Then\nagain, maybe people just like to have pity parties. Whatever the case, one\nthing I know for certain is that the negativity of one person can spawn\nnegativity in another, which can virally transfer to another until an entire\nproduction team is infected. We have seen this happen a few times in our\ncompany’s history. One team member goes sour, and before we know it we’re\nreplacing the whole regime.\n\nPerhaps the biggest cause of the spread of negativity is complaining.\nComplaining inspires complaining. Don’t get me wrong, there may be valid\nthings for you to complain about: Your client makes ugly changes to your best\ndesign. A surprise deadline keeps you at the office late.",

Don’t get me wrong, there may be valid\nthings for you to complain about: Your client makes ugly changes to your best\ndesign. A surprise deadline keeps you at the office late. Your chair is\nuncomfortable. Your computer is too slow. Your boss is an idiot. The power to\nthe building just went out. These and many other challenges surround a\ndesigner every day. But complaining about them becomes as addictive a habit as\nsmoking, and serves only to highlight issues and does nothing to correct them.\n\nI’ll give you three suggestions here for making the most of the situation.\nFirst, instead of being a contributor to office negativity, it is imperative\nto your success to try to stay positive amidst the frustrations of the design\nworld. Negative attitudes that stem from complaining will be felt by your\nclients, coworkers, and bosses. Body language and tone of voice are dead\ngiveaways to negative attitudes—it would be foolish to assume otherwise. Also,\nit would behoove you to realize how quickly a negative comment or persona can\nspread. Much like a rampant wildfire or two extremely enthusiastic bunnies, a\npoor attitude and a heart filled with contention can douse the flame of\ncreativity and joy in an instant, causing grumbling and complaining to\nmultiply at an alarming rate.\n\nSecond, realize that oftentimes the solution to someone’s negative mindset\ncould be found and acted upon in less time than it takes to give voice to the\ncomplaint. If you have a tight deadline, for example, hunker down and get to\nwork. The time you waste complaining to your coworker about your client and\ntheir unrealistic deadline could be better used in actually working toward\nachieving the milestone and making your client happy in the process.\n\nAnd as a third suggestion to benefit both the company and yourself, take\nproactive steps toward improving the situation that is creating the problem.\nIf your computer is too slow, let your boss know and help research a solution.\nIf a client is consistently demanding rush changes or unreasonable deadlines,\nwork to implement a better set of project expectations the next time you begin\na project. Rather than complain about your frustrations to your coworkers,\nproactively present solutions up the chain of command in your business. Your\ngoal should be to leave your place of work better than you found it; be a\nbeacon of positivity in a stormy sea of negative attitudes.\n\nThe blockbuster movie _Saving Private Ryan_ seems to be on television every\nother weekend, much to my delight. I find myself watching it with devout\ninterest nearly every time it is on. Several of the scenes are imprinted on my\nmind, and one brief verbal exchange between Tom Hanks’ character, Captain\nMiller, and a private under his command had a significant impact on me. In it,\nPrivate Reiben questions his captain about the fact that he never gripes.\nCaptain Miller responds by saying that “Gripes go up, not down.” In other\nwords, a captain gripes to his superiors, not the other way around, and never\ngripes in front of those below him in rank.\n\nThis movie may have told a fictional story, but the advice is true. Griping to\nyour coworkers serves only to breed negativity. Griping up the chain of\ncommand can help bring about positive change.\n\nIn my company, we’ve become highly intolerant of negative attitudes within our\nteam. As soon as an employee exhibits a negative attitude, we call them in for\na chat. We dig in to discover what is frustrating them and work together to\nhelp solve the problem. We didn’t do this in the past, and we watched our\nnegative cultures spin out of control. I’ve seen a “bad apple ruin the whole\nbunch” several times in my career. Don’t be a bad apple.\n\n![Image](../images/00012.jpeg)\n\n\n## 9\\.",

The “Stress\nBucket” chapter has been on my list of things to write for over a year.\nUltimately, it took some experiences here in New York to inject the final\ninspiration into this task. There are cars everywhere and people swarming the\nstreets like ants. Many of the New Yorkers handle the stress of living in the\nbig city with apparent ease. But a few times per day I’ll pass people who have\njust “lost it.” One guy in particular was shouting expletives at his wife that\nhe’d “had it.” He was “done.” I was not sure what led up to his explosion, but\nit was obvious that his stress bucket was full.\n\nYou see, everyone has a stress bucket. As you go through your day, your bucket\nfills and empties depending on your activities. On days when you have lots of\nmeetings and demands weighing on you, the bucket fills quickly. On other days,\nlike weekends, there may be little stress in your bucket, allowing the time to\npass with relative ease. If you don’t empty your bucket and it keeps filling\nwith stress, it will eventually overflow and an explosion of stress will\noccur, like the gentleman in New York. Sometimes, when your bucket is filled\nnearly to the top, all it takes is “one more drop” to make it overflow.\n\nYou’ve undoubtedly heard the phrase, “That’s the last straw!” This phrase\noriginated as a mid-17th–century proverb (according to the Oxford Dictionary\nof Quotations) referring to the idea that one final piece of straw added to\nthe back of a camel would make the load unbearable and cause the animal’s back\nto break.\n\nEveryone has seen (and likely experienced) this breaking point at some point\nin their lives—that time when a simple thing makes even the calmest of people\nfreak out. Where do you think the expression “Don’t cry over spilled milk”\ncame from? Obviously, babies’ stress buckets don’t hold much and all it takes\nfor them to “lose it” is something as simple as a spilled cup of milk.\n\nA graphic designer’s life can be a deadline-driven, emotionally stressful\nworld. As my company was growing in the early years, we were doubling our\nbilling and staff every year. I was a stressed-out wreck! Just ask my family\nor any of my employees at the time. Most of them can share with you stories\nabout my bloodshot eyes, which I refer to as “Cylon Raider mode” (this phrase\nis derived from red-eyed cylons in the popular 1970s version of _Battlestar\nGallactica_); I was strung out on stress.\n\nIn the workplace, keeping your stress bucket in check is important. If you\ndon’t, you will inevitably cause those near you to walk on egg shells, and\nworry about everything they say and do around you. You really have two choices\nwhen it comes to managing your stress. You can either have a really big stress\nbucket, or you can empty a smaller bucket regularly. Here are some techniques\nthat I’ve learned in the trenches to keep my stress bucket in check. Keep in\nmind these are in no way backed by scientific research or focus-group testing;\nthey are just a few things I do in an effort to keep my stress bucket from\ngushing over:\n\n• Take a break. Get up from your desk and go for a short walk. Take a few deep\nbreaths and get that oxygen flowing.\n\n• Clean up your desk and your work area, since clutter contributes to stress.\nKeeping your workspace organized and clean lightens your load.\n\n• File emails.

My Inbox is my lifeblood. If it gets loaded with hundreds of\nmessages, I start worrying that I’ve forgotten something. Keep your Inbox\nclean, and make sure that you respond quickly to your emails to keep them from\nbuilding up and adding drops of stress to your bucket.\n\n• Get a task started. Sometimes the mounting pressure of an upcoming task can\nbe lessened by simply getting it started. If you have some comps to design,\ntake a few minutes to create a new Photoshop file with the correct dimensions.\nPlace some of your design assets into the document on separate layers, and\nthen save the file. This simple task takes only a couple of minutes and can\nlighten your load just enough so your stress bucket doesn’t overflow.\n\n• Take out a piece of paper and write down every task you have to complete.\nThis activity often reveals that you have less to do than you think. And even\nif you have more to do than you think, the organization of information helps\nto relieve some of the burden.\n\n• Keep your finances in check. It comes as no surprise that, unfortunately,\nthe bulk of the stress that people face often relates to money. As a business\nowner, I regularly watch hundreds of thousands of dollars come into the\ncompany’s bank account and then go right back out. It stresses me out! I’ve\nfound that much of this stress can be alleviated by simply counting the money.\nAdd it all up and then figure out how long it will last you. (See the chapter\ntitled “[Next Worry Date](part0114.html#ch103)” in [Section\n5](part0089.html#part05) for additional information.)\n\n• Email your clients. Sometimes stress can mount from not knowing where you\nstand with your clients. Take a few minutes and email a message of\nappreciation. A quick email like, “Just wanted to let you know that we enjoy\nworking with you and appreciate the projects you send our way. Thanks for\nbeing a great client,” can entice a response from a client like, “Thanks for\nthe message. We enjoy working with you, too.” This type of positive\naffirmation response can take stress out of your bucket.\n\n• During one fast-growing year in my business, I drank an awful lot of diet\ncola drinks. I now refer to that year as “The Anxiety Disorder of 2006.” I am\nspeaking only from personal, not scientific, experience when I say that\ncaffeine contributes to stress; I know it contributed to mine. You can dig up\nplenty of research out there that discusses the effects that caffeine has on\nthe body.\n\n• Get regular exercise. Not only am I a workaholic, I’m a work-out-aholic. I\nhit the gym at least five days a week in the mornings before I go into the\noffice. I know that regular exercise helps to lessen stress.\n\n• Sleep seven to eight hours per night. Giving your body the rest it needs\nhelps keep your stress bucket from overflowing.\n\n• Eat healthy. Again, no scientific research here—just a simple truth that is\ngrounded in my own life experience. Consuming healthy foods keeps your body\nfunctioning properly and can have a positive impact on your stress level.\n\n• Mend a bridge. Many of us carry long-term burdens by having damaged\nrelationships in our past. Walking around with this baggage can make the\nminimum level in your stress bucket be at least halfway full (or more). Figure\nout some ways to mend the bridge and humble yourself enough to act on them.\n\nThe stress bucket is real, and keeping it from overflowing can be a challenge\nin the stressful, deadline-driven world of graphic design. The best way to\nfight against this is to have an arsenal of stress-fighting techniques at the\nready for whenever the need arises.\n\n!",

No matter how talented and\nfilled with integrity you are, you will have some pretty miserable\nprofessional moments:\n\n• You might find yourself laid off and have trouble finding a new job.\n\n• You might have to deal regularly with an overbearing, idiotic, know-it-all\nboss.\n\n• Perhaps you’ll lose money, maybe even a lot of it.\n\n• Clients will abuse you and pull projects from you.\n\n• Some clients may even drop you as a vendor through no apparent fault of your\nown.\n\n• You’ll probably get stiffed on an invoice or two...or three...\n\n• Late nights will happen.\n\n• There will be bugs in your code or computer crashes that make you go\nprematurely gray.\n\n• Clients will change scope on a project over and over again, and still expect\nyou to execute for the same amount of money.\n\n• The best comps you have ever created may be thrown in the trash with\ninstructions to go back to the drawing board.\n\n• The proverbial bus will probably roll over you again and again.\n\nYou can’t avoid it. These things happen in nearly everyone’s career.\n(Everything in the above list has happened in mine.) There is virtually\nnothing you can do to prevent the inevitable, but the one thing you have\ncontrol over is how you react. You have control over yourself. Through it all,\nhow you use that control will mean one of two things will happen: You will\neither become Grandpa #1 or Grandpa #2.\n\nGrandpa #1 is the guy who everybody knows and secretly fears. Perhaps he lived\ndown the street when you were a kid. He was the old, crotchety character\nsitting on the front porch. Every time you came near his yard you were nervous\nthat he’d start yelling at you to stay off his grass. Maybe he falsely accused\nyou of stepping on his flowers. Most likely he has a BB gun on his lap waiting\nfor the neighbor’s dog to set “just one foot” on his lawn. Grandpa #1 is a\ngrumpy old man who seems to be against everything in the world. Everything he\nsees is negative. “The world is circling the drain on the way to perdition,”\nhe thinks.\n\nGrandpa #2 is quite different. Most people know a Grandpa #2. He is the guy\nwho has all the answers. His gentle, patient soul calms the whole family—all\nthe way down to the great, great grandkids. He is admired and revered by all\nwho know him. He has seen it all in his life and therefore can help guide you\nthrough the challenges that come your way. He is a sage, a captain, a tried\nand true leader. When the world is in chaos all around, Grandpa #2 calmly\nsays, “All this will pass and we’ll be just fine.”\n\nGrandpa #1 and Grandpa #2 probably had very similar lives. Both, like everyone\nelse in the world, had their fair share of challenges and trials. The big\ndifference between the two, however, was how they chose to deal with\nadversity. And these choices had a lot to do with the things they said to\nthemselves in their toughest times.\n\nThroughout his life as the world raged around him, Grandpa #1 likely said\nthings like this:\n\n“Who is to blame for this problem? Cuz it certainly isn’t me!”\n\n“This sucks. One more thing like this and I’m quitting.”\n\n“The Man is keeping me down.”\n\n“My boss is such a jerk.”\n\nOn the other hand, Grandpa #2 probably viewed things differently and asked\nhimself this:\n\n“What can I learn from this experience?”\n\n“What do I need to change in my life so I don’t have this same challenge\nagain?”\n\n“How can I help others avoid this problem?”\n\n“What steps do I need to take to remedy this situation?”\n\nThis simple difference in point of view meant Grandpa #1 grew to become an\nunapproachable grump, while Grandpa #2 grew to become patient and wise. How we\nturn out in life has everything to do with how we respond to the challenges we\ninevitably will face.\n\nPay attention to the things you say to yourself the next time your boss shoots\ndown your comps or a client chews you out. Who are you becoming, Grandpa #1 or\nGrandpa #2?\n\n\n## 11\\.

    "chunk_full": "## 11\\. Be a Wall Painter\n\nIn the early days of my business, after hiring a new employee we would all go\nout to lunch together to celebrate the new addition to our team. This\ntradition included the “telling of our worst jobs ever.” The new employee\nwould tell us their worst job and then the current reigning champion of the\n“worst job ever stories” would tell their story.\n\nNate, one of our first hires, is still the reigning champion. Nobody has\nknocked him off the worst job pedestal. What is his claim to “worst job” fame?\nIt was his time making dog jerky. He would put on a rubber suit and spend all\nday in a freezer room pouring frozen meat by-products into a giant blender. At\nthe start of the day, the meat by-products would be frozen. But as the day\nprogressed, things would begin to thaw, and the freezer and his rubber suit\nwould quickly fill with the blood and guts of the once-frozen meat.\nInevitably, the rotten smell would seep through the rubber suit, mix with his\nsweat, and embed itself deep into Nate’s skin. Even a long, hot shower after\nhis hard day of work would not expunge the putrid smell from his pores.\n\nThis job (and I’m sure many others) that Nate has held in his life have molded\nhim into one of the most hardworking, dedicated, and humble people I have ever\nworked with. Although he is a designer and production artist at our company,\nhe is nearly always the first person to volunteer for any odd job that comes\nup. It is not uncommon to see Nate move a desk, paint a wall, take out trash,\nclean out a storage room, or change a light bulb. He does these things without\ncomplaint and I often imagine that he is comparing his cushy job sitting in an\noffice chair designing things on his computer to his grueling days making dog\njerky. Nate was our company’s first Employee of the Year, and his service-\nminded attitude continues to make him invaluable to our business.\n\n![Image](../images/00014.jpeg)\n\nI was recently watching a biography about Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald’s.\nI was astonished to learn that one out of eight Americans has worked at\nMcDonald’s. If you happen to be one of the fortunate 12.5 percent of the\nnation who has worked there, I say, “Congratulations.” You are probably a\nbetter worker for it.\n\nSometimes I joke to our team, “We’ll fly out and plunge our client’s toilets\nif they ask us to.” It comes out as a joke, but truthfully, I would do it. It\nis not beneath me.\n\nI am grateful for the work ethic and lessons I learned in each of my humble\njobs. Here is a list of my colorful job history:\n\n• Detassled corn (entailed walking through corn fields pulling the leaves off\nthe top of each stalk)\n\n• Babysitter\n\n• YMCA youth day-camp counselor\n\n• Lawn mower for neighbors’ yards\n\n• YMCA lifeguard\n\n• YMCA swimming and diving instructor\n\n• YMCA fitness center consultant\n\n• Wagon Wheel Playhouse usher\n\n• Walmart (stocked shelves in third shift)*\n\n• Temp employee (fed a binder)\n\n• Ponderosa restaurant waiter*\n\n• Lawn mower for the school system\n\n• Arby’s restaurant (I made the sandwiches)*\n\n• Roofer\n\n• Head Start preschool (teacher for Spanish-speaking migrant worker children)\n\n• Indiana University football (ushered for football games)\n\n• Indiana University graduate dorm library (yep, I was a librarian)\n\n• Telemarketer\n\n• AlphaGraphics (prepress coordinator—my first job out of college)\n\n• Reynolds Graphics (junior designer)\n\n• Market Direct (graphic designer at a direct marketing agency)\n\n• Futech/oKID (creative director)\n\n• Fox (senior creative director, Fox Studio; managed the design, development,\nand editorial of the Fox Kids and the Fox Family websites)\n\n• Riser (founder, CEO, toilet cleaner, wall painter)*\n\nI put an asterisk next to each job in which I cleaned a public restroom at one\ntime or another. I’m not presuming that my eclectic job history makes me\nbetter than other people. However, I know that I am a better person than I\nwould have been had I not gone through these diverse job experiences.

This humbling task teaches so many lessons, among which is the\nwillingness to do whatever the job requires. I have seen over and over again\nin my career that the people who are willing to go the extra mile and do\nwhatever task is required of them by their boss or client are among the most\nvalued in the company.\n\nWe have won many awards throughout our company’s history, one of which is the\n“Best of State” award for Utah, and which we have proudly won many times.

Your job is to make a client’s life easier. They are\ncoming to you in need of help. They can’t design these things themselves. They\nhave external pressures mounting on them that only you can alleviate.\nUltimately, cleaning public toilets early in life is not the only way to learn\ngratitude and humble service to others.

Every Position Can Be Electrifying\n\nThere are three things that I really love in this world: my family, the\nChicago Bears, and my Jeep. Which order these fall in, I’ll let you decide.\nDevin Hester is a kick returner on the Chicago Bears. In 2006 and 2007, he\nbroke the NFL single-season record for kick returns two years in a row. In his\nfirst two NFL seasons, he had 11 total kick or punt returns; that is only two\nreturns shy of the all-time NFL record of 13 held by Brian Mitchell (which\ntook Brian Mitchell an entire NFL career to set.) Devin Hester is a game\nchanger.\n\n![Image](../images/00015.jpeg)\n\nNow let’s run down the list of other electrifying players in NFL history\n(Peyton Manning, Barry Sanders, Randy Moss, Walter Payton, and Joe Montana may\ncome to mind). For those of you not up-to-date on football stats, that list\ncontains quarterbacks, running backs, and wide receivers...typically the\nposition played by the “electrifying” and “difference making” players. In the\n2006 season, Devin Hester of the Chicago Bears was arguably the most\nelectrifying, game changing player in the entire NFL and he is a KICK\nRETURNER! Now take a minute and name other kick returners in the NFL...maybe\nyou came up with one or two...maybe (out of 31 other teams). The kick returner\nposition has never been what Devin Hester made it to be in his first two\nseasons.\n\nSo what is my point?\n\n**In football team terms:** In the NFL, you don’t have to be the quarterback\nto make an impact. Devin Hester proves that a kick returner can have as big an\nimpact on the success of a team as the superstar quarterback, running back, or\nwide receiver. In the case of Devin Hester, he made it so that opposing teams\nhad to alter their game strategies; by the end of the 2007 season, many teams\neven began kicking the ball away from him to keep him from having a chance to\nmake a game-changing play.\n\n**In graphic design team terms:** You don’t have to be the art director,\ncreative director, CTO, or VP of blah-de-blah agency to be a key member of a\ncompany. Any role, any position, in any organization can have a huge impact on\nthe success of the organization. Throughout my career, I have seen junior\nprogrammers and junior designers make HUGE impacts on company success. By\nstriving to maximize your contribution, regardless of the position you fill on\nthe org chart, you can make an impact.\n\nHere are a few questions you can ask yourself to help you become electrifying\nin your current role:\n\n• What could I do to be better at my job?\n\n• What are some areas in this company that need improvement and what can I do\nto help improve them?\n\n• What should I be learning to help me improve my skills?\n\n• How can I help my coworkers with their job responsibilities?\n\n• Is there something I can do to help improve our office culture?\n\n• How are our production processes working and what suggestions can I make to\nimprove them?\n\n• What are my unique qualities and characteristics that I can utilize outside\nof my current role?\n\n• Am I dedicating some time each day to thinking outside of the box? Or am I\ndoing only the jobs assigned to me?\n\nAsk yourself these questions and get serious about answering them, and you\nwill be well on your way to becoming a dominant player on your company’s team.\n\n![Image](../images/00016.jpeg)\n\n* * *\n\nYOU DON’T HAVE TO BE\n\nTHE ART DIRECTOR,\n\nCREATIVE DIRECTOR, CTO, OR\n\nVP OF BLAH-DE-BLAH AGENCY\n\nTO BE A KEY MEMBER\n\nOF A COMPANY.\n\n* * *",

I was struck by something he said while relating a story about\na new scoutmaster he was going to be working with. The speaker gave the\nscoutmaster a set of Scout manuals to which the scoutmaster responded, “Now\nwhich of these do I really have to read?” The speaker then promptly replied,\n“Well, that depends on whether you want to LEAD or be LED.”\n\nThis statement had a huge impact on me. Among many other attributes that the\nleaders around us possess, this statement emphasizes that leaders are\nfrequently the most educated about the subject matter, and the most prepared\nto guide others and make decisions based on their understanding of the\nappropriate materials.\n\nIf we want to lead, we must educate ourselves and prepare to make decisions\nand guide others. Over the course of my career, I have been on an unceasing\nquest to educate myself on numerous things that I felt were inhibiting growth\nin my career. After graduating from college, I taught myself HTML and\nconsequently became a key employee in one of my first jobs. While there, I\ntaught myself Flash 2.0 and 3D modeling, which helped me land my next two jobs\nand be promoted several times, during which time I taught myself Flash 3.0 and\n4.0.

Subsequently, during\nmy time as a business owner I have read countless books on business\nmanagement. This thirst for knowledge has made all the difference in helping\nme progress and succeed in my chosen career.\n\nIf you want to be a leader, it is imperative that you figure out what you\ndon’t know and take the necessary steps to learn it, no matter what it is and\nwhat it requires of you.",

Half the Victory\n\nOne of the biggest failings and sure signs of a junior designer is to sit in a\nmeeting like a wallflower at a high school dance with nothing to say or\ncontribute to the party. It is OK to be a little shy and even better to be a\nlittle humble. But even the meek look strong when they have something of value\nto contribute.\n\nSome people are born with the gift of gab. Others naturally and organically\ndevelop it over the course of their lives. Still others need to work at it\nlike they would to develop any other talent. If it doesn’t come naturally, it\nis worth your effort to improve your public speaking and presentation skills.\nThese abilities will help you land jobs and clients as you venture through\nyour life as a graphic designer.\n\nMy oldest son is a Boy Scout working his way toward earning his Eagle Scout\nAward. I have come to know the Boy Scout Motto, “Be prepared,” as I have\nparticipated in activities with him. What a simple and great piece of advice!\nWe should all apply this nugget of wisdom in many aspects of our lives.\n\nNot only does this counsel help an eager Boy Scout survive in the wilderness,\nit can help a designer thrive in the workplace. Next time you are called to a\nmeeting, don’t be like the junior designer wallflower; instead, be sure to\nprepare some things in advance:\n\n• Be sure to have something to write on. A note pad, your Moleskine®, a laptop\ncomputer—the tool or device doesn’t matter as much as the image that you will\npresent when you are prepared to take notes and look interested.\n\n• Do some research and review before the meeting to ensure that the topic is\nfresh in your mind. If you are meeting with a new client, be sure to learn all\nyou can about them by searching the Web and exploring their website.\n\n• Jot down a few intelligent questions and muster the courage to ask them. It\nis much easier to come up with intelligent questions beforehand than in the\nheat of the moment.\n\n• Bring some advice. Plan on sharing a recent lesson learned to help educate\nsomeone else. When done tactfully, this can help you look experienced and\nknowledgeable.\n\n• Plan to share a compliment about another attendee. Do you like a client’s\nbrand or product? Tell them and be specific. Did a coworker help you execute\non a sticky deadline? Share the experience in your next staff meeting so\neveryone knows how great this person is.\n\n• Share an opinion. In your next design critique, be sure to have some\nintelligent opinions to share. Don’t just receive opinions; share some of your\nown.\n\nSome action is better than no action. With a little preparation before a\nmeeting, you can transform your image from that of an inexperienced mouse to\nthat of a seasoned and competent design professional.\n\n![Image](../images/00018.jpeg)",

Indiana University was wonderful...but I remember thinking\nwith a smile on my face, “I will never be in school again.” Unhappily, it took\nabout a month of job searching for me to realize that my degree didn’t\nguarantee me a job. I also realized my college portfolio and zero experience\nweren’t exactly “wowing” any potential employers. Finally, the day came when I\nlanded my first “real” job: prepress coordinator at the local AlphaGraphics,\nmaking just a tad above minimum wage.\n\nNow, AlphaGraphics is a fine organization, but it isn’t exactly the Madison\nAvenue dream career of an ambitious new graphic design grad. I was grateful to\nhave “a job” and realized that my college degree helped me “learn how to\nlearn,” but it did not give me all the skills I would need to succeed as a\ngraphic designer.\n\nSo, in true Michael Janda OCD form, I took it upon myself to learn everything\nI could about the design industry. At every company I have ever worked at, I\nhave engaged in the ambitious goal of learning new skills. In the mid-1990s, I\ntaught myself skills that proved to open doors for me at new companies where I\nserved in creative director roles (including Fox Studios). I am also\nconstantly scouring design galleries and magazines to stay current on design\ntrends. As my role has shifted to that of business owner, I have devoured\nbusiness books to earn my “MBA” in the trenches of real life. The point is\nthat I have used idle time to build my own skill set, which has led to\ncountless professional opportunities and significant growth in my career.\n\nToo often I have seen team members and employees at companies I’ve worked at\n(and my own company) piddle away their idle but company time playing games,\nwatching videos, and poking around social media sites. Shame on them for\nwasting employer dollars. And even bigger shame heaped upon them for wasting\nvaluable time that could have gone toward benefiting their professional\nfuture.\n\nMy questions to you are: What are you doing with your downtime? Where do you\nwant your career to go? What are you teaching yourself to help get you there?\nI implore you to teach yourself new skills and do all you can to stay current\nwith industry standard technologies and design trends. Most employers are\nhappy to see employees take initiative to learn new things, as these new\nskills will contribute to the success of their business.\n\nLook around your workplace. What areas need improvement? What can you do to\nhelp? In my experience, even the worst bosses typically reward ambition and\nproblem-solving steps that contribute to improvement of their company. Can you\nhelp with company marketing efforts online? Can you make suggestions to\nimprove processes and systems in the company and then champion their\nimplementation? Heck, take out the trash if you have to. Idle time that you\nare being paid for should be used to benefit the company that pays your bills\nand puts the Hot Pockets® on your table.\n\n* * *\n\nWHAT ARE YOU DOING\n\nWITH YOUR DOWN TIME?\n\nWHERE DO YOU WANT\n\nYOUR CAREER TO GO?\n\nWHAT ARE YOU\n\nTEACHING YOURSELF\n\nTO HELP GET YOU THERE?\n\n* * *",

I’m Not a Writer\n\nI was recently interviewing a candidate for a design position at our company.\nIn response to one of the interview questions, he naively said, “I’m not a\nwriter.” I immediately thought (but did not say), “You want to be a graphic\ndesigner? That means you’re a designer, a writer, a programmer, a\nphotographer, and sometimes an illustrator.”\n\nAs a graphic designer, you often have to fill in the holes left by your\nclient’s inability to deliver necessary assets. Also, if you want to be in a\nposition where you can consistently over-deliver and go the extra mile for\nyour clients, you need to be able to tap into a rich reservoir of talents and\nskills that go beyond those you graduated art school with. So be prepared to\npolish your skills in every trade associated with graphic design, because\nyou’re going to need them.\n\nNot only that, a graphic designer that is part of a small company should\nassume they will also have to be a computer fixer, a phone answerer, a sales\nrepresentative, a furniture mover, a wall painter, a picture hanger, a desk\nassembler, a trash taker-outer...you get the idea. The more hats you are\nwilling to wear, the better team player you will be. Your coworkers and\nsupervisors will appreciate you more as you contribute to the success of the\nbusiness in more ways than just amazing them with your killer design skills.\n\nWe as human beings were made to go through life continuing to assimilate\ninformation and grow; our ability to digest new things and add to our natural\nskill sets is what separates us from the zoo animals we gape at on the\nweekends. We would be foolish to think otherwise. It is therefore imperative\nthat we strive for excellence everywhere—not just in our proclaimed field of\nspecialty.\n\n![Image](../images/00019.jpeg)",

Among them is\nthe universal truth that “crap naturally floats to the surface.” Inevitably,\nthe top layer of the channels in the lake would contain many treasures such as\ndead fish, trash, and seaweed. Sure, the lake was filled with good stuff as\nwell: beautiful bass and other fish swam beneath the surface. But the only\ntime you saw them rise to the surface was when they were dead and rotting.\n\nAs a boss and graphic design business owner, I’ve learned that this same thing\nholds true in business settings. “Crap naturally floats to the surface.” When\na project goes awry, people hear about it up the chain of command. When a\nclient is upset, your boss will inevitably find out. If a deadline is missed,\nword spreads. The “crap” in a design agency naturally floats to the surface\nfor all to see. It is rare that a client will call your boss to tell them what\na great job you are doing, but they certainly will call when you do a crappy\njob.\n\nThe “good stuff,” unfortunately, requires effort to circulate. Unlike the\n“crappy stuff,” you will have to make an effort to share the good things that\nhappen during the course of your projects with your coworkers and boss.\n\nFor example, it is not uncommon that a client will email you a compliment on\nyour good work. This is the type of “good stuff” that you have to make an\neffort to circulate inside your company. A simple email forwarding the message\nfrom the client with a message of your own saying, “Just received this from\nthe client. Kudos to everyone on this project!” is usually sufficient to get\nthe compliment passed around.\n\nAnother thing we’ve done at our agency is the occasional “Expose Yourself\nFriday” meeting. As need arises, we set aside an hour or so on a Friday and\ngive everyone on our team a few minutes to show off projects they’ve been\nworking on. This not only lets the “good stuff” come to the surface, it also\nprovides an opportunity for everyone on the team to see the cool work that\ntheir teammates are producing. It serves as a great way to circulate\npositivity, helping employees feel more appreciated.\n\nYour boss is probably very busy and, if you’re lucky, won’t often meddle in\nyour projects. If you want to make sure they know the great job you’re doing,\nchances are you have to make an effort to show them. My father-in-law has\nalways said, “You have to toot your own horn, because nobody is going to toot\nit for you.” If you don’t have a reporting structure to show off your\nstuff...all your boss will likely hear will be the negative things that\nhappened. Take the time to prove your worth and let your good works speak for\nthemselves.\n\n![Image](../images/00020.jpeg)\n\n![Image](../images/00021.jpeg)",

    "chunk_full": "## 18\\. Don’t Work in a Vacuum\n\n“Don’t work in a vacuum.” Of course I didn’t coin the phrase, but when I first\nstarted spreading this statement around the office, I honestly had some people\nthink that I was talking about a vacuum cleaner. Don’t be fooled, though—what\nI want you to be thinking about is space: the final frontier. Most of us have\nseen a movie where some guy gets sucked out of his spaceship into outer space.\nHis love interest is inside the ship with no way to save him. The soft, sad\nmusic is playing while they touch hands against the glass. She is crying. He\nis dying. He has no way to move, no way to speak, no way to breathe. He is\ncompletely alone in the vacuum of outer space.\n\nI spent three years of my life working in that vacuum. I was a basement-based,\none-man show. No critiques, no internal feedback, no fresh outside ideas—just\nme cranking out some of the best mediocre work in America. Sure, my mediocre\nwork was good enough to make my clients happy and even keep them coming back\nfor more. It was even good enough for those relatively happy clients to spread\nmy name around. But I know for a fact that my work is even better when I\ncollaborate with others.\n\nOnce I began hiring people, I was quickly reminded how influential\ncollaborating with others can be on the quality and reach of any given design.\nTime after time, I saw good design turned into great design through\ncollaboration.\n\nThe simplest way to get out of the vacuum you work in is to simply spin your\nchair around and say, “Hey, what do you think of this?” If you are working in\nan office environment, there is likely someone nearby who can provide some\ntype of feedback. Don’t be arrogant and make the mistake of thinking that your\nfeedback needs to come from another designer; this type of pride and blindness\ncan lead you down the path that leads to design worthy only of the yellow\npages. Anyone can provide insights that can improve your work. Some of the\nmost helpful feedback I have received has come from nondesigners who tend to\nsee things through a consumer’s point of view.\n\nFeedback frequency is also important when it comes to your productivity. You\ndon’t want to get too far down the path of your project before you ask for\nsomeone’s opinion, since there is nothing worse than having a comp almost\ncompleted only to realize that you missed out on integrating a key element, or\nthat you failed to utilize a groundbreaking concept that could have changed\nthe direction of the entire project for the better. I regularly ask of anyone\navailable, “Hey, do you have a second to take a look at this? What would make\nit better?”\n\nNot working in a vacuum applies to everything, not just design projects. We\nhave rules in our office that require everyone to get feedback on everything.\nIf someone is sending an important email to a client, they have someone else\nread it to check for tone and typos before it is sent. Every proposal is\nreviewed by someone other than the writer before they are sent. Pricing and\nproject schedules are also bounced around a few people for feedback before\nthey are sent out.\n\nInevitably, you will receive lousy feedback from time to time. When this\nhappens, simply smile and say, “Thanks.” Remind yourself that 90 percent of\nbrainstorms are typically comprised of bad ideas. It is better to get poor-\nquality feedback and not react to it than to get no feedback at all—especially\nsince that last 10 percent is often where true greatness in unveiled.\n\nIn the end, the best designers swallow their pride and recognize that their\nideas aren’t always the best, and they are willing to collaborate with others\nto create great design work, leaving bad design lost in space where it\nbelongs.",

The Graphic Design Megazord\n\nMy time at Fox Kids had a huge impact on me: I made great friends, had tons of\nfun, and gained the opportunity to work on awesome projects for amazing\nbrands. My own children were very young at the time, and Power Rangers was one\nof Fox Kids’ hit shows. I was literally drowning in Power Rangers\nparaphernalia—Power Rangers shirts, videos, toys, pencils, notebooks, books,\nand costumes were all over our office and my home. My son was three years old\nand he inevitably became a huge fan of the show.\n\nThe genius formula used in each Power Rangers episode goes something like\nthis: the Power Rangers are on the brink of being wiped out by this week’s bad\nguy. The bad guy turns into a giant monster (think Godzilla) and the Rangers\nrealize they cannot possibly beat the giant monster alone. Wisely, the Rangers\njump into their individual vehicles and combine them to form the giant\nMegazord robot. The Red Ranger ship becomes the body. The Blue and Yellow\nRanger ships become the legs. The Pink and Green Ranger ships become the arms.\nA giant sword magically shows up and the Megazord is now powerful enough to\ntake on the evil giant monster and save the world yet again.\n\nSimilarly, the graphic design world is like a giant Power Rangers set. On the\nbase level it may seem like your individual talents and skills are enough to\ntame even the gnarliest of villainous design problems. But even the world’s\nbest superstar designer is stronger in a team. Several people working\nharmoniously together can conquer tasks too great for just one person.\n\nThe “Graphic Design Megazord” concept follows this pattern: Each project is\nassigned to a team of people for execution. The team may consist of a project\nmanager, a senior-level designer, a junior-level designer, a programmer, and a\nquality assurance specialist. The roles of the Graphic Design Megazord will\nvary from project to project and business to business. The point is that a\nteam can accomplish greater tasks than an individual alone can—after all,\nthere are only so many hours in a day, and one person cannot possible serve as\ndesigner, project manager, and creative director without dropping the ball\nsomewhere at some point in the project.\n\nSo fire up the old Red Ranger and transform your abilities and skills into the\ncollaborative masterpieces they were always meant to become.\n\n![Image](../images/00022.jpeg)",

    "chunk_full": "## 20\\. Live as a Team, Die as a Team\n\nAbout five years after starting my design agency, I became acutely aware of\nthe codependent nature of a business. Perhaps these feelings began to swell\nwhen we held our first annual company party at the local amusement park,\nLagoon. Each employee, with his or her family in tow, met at our rented\npavilion for lunch. This was the first time we had all been together in such a\nmanner. I began to count heads and was humbled as I felt the weight of running\nmy business in a way that could continue to provide for all 52 people who were\ndependent on it for their financial support (my dozen employees plus their\nspouses and children).\n\nIt didn’t take long for me to realize that I was also dependent on each of our\nteam members to successfully perform their duties at our company in order for\nmy family to be provided for. And not only that, each employee was dependent\nupon every other employee. The financial repercussions of a project going awry\ncould force me to make hard business decisions about whom we could afford to\nkeep and who might have to be let go.\n\nThe reality is that everyone must feel the responsibility for every project to\nsucceed whether they are assigned to the project or not, because if Jane blows\na project resulting in the loss of a client, John might lose his job.\n\nWhen money becomes tight in an organization, tough business decisions have to\nbe made. In regard to your and other employees’ worth, an employer will\nclosely examine the following items.\n\n**Cost**\n\nHow much do you cost versus how much money the company can bring in due to\nyour efforts? The more profitable you are to the business, the better chance\nyou have of being retained through all but the most grievous circumstances.\n\n**Redundancies**\n\nIf your company has three designers and one programmer, and the programmer is\ninvolved in a botched project, there is a likelihood that one of the designers\nmay be let go when finances require it—even if the project failure was the\nfault of the lone programmer.\n\n**Attitude and Fit**\n\nWhen the economic recession finally hit us early in 2009, we had to make some\ntough decisions. We had plenty of redundancies, and cost versus contribution\nwas pretty much equal across many of our team members. That left us to judge\neach employee’s attitude and cultural fit within our organization; your\ncompany will view the circumstances in the same way we did.\n\nThe truth is that none of us ever want to be on either end of these tough\nbusiness decisions. In order to achieve that goal, we all must feel the weight\nand responsibility of each and every project to succeed. If a designer on\nSally’s team fails to do their job, the result could be that a designer on\nRalph’s team has to dust off their résumé and find new employment.",

    "chunk_full": "## 21\\. Everyone Does Something Better Than You\n\nIn my early twenties, I spent some time living in the northern coastal cities\nof Colombia. Part of my soul longs to be there still, as I made some amazing\nfriends and fell in love with the culture. My experience there was also filled\nwith unique and deeply meaningful life lessons. One of those lessons was\ntaught to me by a dear friend from Bogotá.\n\nMy friend and I were chatting one day, and I was discussing some of the\nchallenges I had with the personality quirks of a mutual acquaintance. Human\nnature makes it easy for us to notice the flaws in others. This practice\nbreeds negativity and inhibits teamwork, two things that can critically\ninfluence success in the field of graphic design.\n\nMy Colombian friend gave me some advice that has stuck with me throughout my\nlife. He said, “Everyone does something better than you.” He then proceeded to\ninstruct me that with everyone he meets, he tries to figure out what that\n“something” is, and then emulates it. This strategy changed my outlook on life\nand my perception of others, and I immediately began practicing this point of\nview.\n\nWhen I find myself negatively noticing the flaws in others, I humbly attempt\nto figure out what that person does better than me. There is always something.\nAdmittedly, with some people you have to look harder than with others, but\nwith everyone I’ve met, I’ve managed to find one thing that they can do better\nthan me.\n\nTake a minute to look around your office. Examine the people there. If you\ncould incorporate one attribute into your life from each person, what would it\nbe? With a humble outlook, I often don’t have to search very hard:\n\nIf I knew all the keystrokes that our production artist Nate knows, I would be\na faster production artist.\n\nIf I had the organizational skills that our office manager Rachel has, my life\nwould be less stressful.\n\nIf I knew ActionScript like our programmer Brent does, I would be\nirreplaceable.\n\nIf I had the client-relation skills that my right-hand person Jeff has, I\nwould be a better project manager.\n\nIf I could draw like our illustrator Christian, I would be a more well-rounded\ngraphic designer.\n\nIf I could work as fast as our creative director Josh does, I would get home\nearly every day.\n\nIf I was as fun and kind hearted as our art director Andrew, nobody would ever\nwant to leave my company, and every client in the world would want to work\nwith me.\n\nThis exercise produces three results. First, it keeps you humble. Second, it\nhelps you appreciate those around you, which leads to less infighting and\nother behaviors that are culturally counterproductive. Third, it should give\nyou a list of things that you can work to improve in your life to make you a\nbetter graphic designer and an all-around better human being.",

    "chunk_full": "## 22\\. You Are Responsible for Your Own Time\n\nEvery designer or agency that has achieved any measure of success has endured\nthe experience of late nights and weekend work. They happen. They are\ninevitable. This is an unfortunate part of the graphic design industry. If you\nare lucky, you will work at a place that fights against the late-night current\nand strives to schedule things in a way that gets you out of the office at a\nreasonable hour.\n\nAt our agency, there were a few years in a row where we were doubling our\nbillings. This type of growth proved very difficult to manage. The unfortunate\nthing is that I often felt alone in my efforts to manage the growth: I would\nhire more people, use freelancers, create production systems, give\nmotivational messages, buy everyone lunch, give out bonuses—but none of it\nseemed to get the workload under control. As a result, our team ended up\nputting in a lot of late nights and I became sincerely disheartened by it. I\ntruly valued my employees and respected their family and personal time. This\nwas not the type of work environment I wanted for my company.\n\n![Image](../images/00023.jpeg)\n\nIn the space of one week, by chance I had two separate, closed-door meetings\nwith two different employees, both of which helped me to recognize the key to\nour excessive-hours problem. The discussion I had with each employee\ncontrasted greatly.\n\nEmployee #1 came into my office, closed the door, and sat down. He had stayed\nlate the night before and started the conversation by saying, “Morale is at an\nall-time low. People are sick of staying late. What are you going to do about\nit?” He was looking for someone to solve the problem for him. He didn’t bring\nany solutions to the table. I immediately started thinking of all the things I\nhad already done (hiring, bonuses, raises, modifying processes). None of it\nwas enough and I needed help. I needed his help, but he didn’t offer any\nsolutions to the problem. His speech only served to make me hyperaware of the\nproblem we had with morale. In essence, he was blaming me for his late nights.\n\nA couple days later, Employee #2 approached me requesting a similar closed-\ndoor meeting. He had stayed all night the night before to hit an important\ndeadline for a major Hollywood studio. I braced myself for another complaint-\nfest. Instead, Employee #2 began his conversation by saying, “I just want you\nto know that I love my job. I really like working here. I’m doing the best I\ncan to get things done.” Instead of looking for someone else to blame for his\nlate night, he was blaming himself. He was worried about getting fired for not\ngetting the work done faster. He saw ample areas where he could improve and\nlisted them for me with advisement that he was working to get better. A huge\nmoment of relief swept over me. I appreciated this employee and his extra\nefforts, and he recognized that. And his willingness to personally find ways\nto improve his workload helped me discover that each employee could work\ntowards finding the balance in their own workload.\n\nEmployee #1 didn’t last much longer at our company. He and several others—not\nsurprisingly—sought new employment. On the other hand, Employee #2 continues\nto be an important cog in our machine.\n\nI learned a lot about people and management during this challenging\nexperience. One of those lessons is that “You are responsible for your own\ntime.” Before you go blaming others for your overtime schedule, look at\nyourself. Are you using all your time effectively? Have you presented\nsolutions to the frustrations you are experiencing in the workplace? Have you\nasked for help from your teammates? Have you delegated pieces of the project\nto others who are not as busy? Take responsibility for your own time and focus\non trying to be part of the solution, not part of the problem.\n\n![Image](../images/00024.jpeg)\n\n\n# Section 2: Art Smarts\n\nTHE BEST DESIGNERS TAKE “LUCK” OUT OF THE EQUATION.

SMART PROCESSES,\nSTRATEGIES, AND TECHNIQUES WILL HELP YOU CREATE A MASTERPIECE EVERY TIME.\n\n\n## 23\\. OCD Is an Attribute\n\nI will never forget my first press check. I had designed a brochure for a\nclient of the direct marketing agency I was working for in Phoenix.\nAdmittedly, I felt cool that I was able to go to the press check. The hour and\na half drive to Tucson went quickly due to my enthusiasm; I was like a kid\nleaving for a family vacation on the coast, knowing that ahead of me lay all\nthe wonders and excitement of the unknown. The printer greeted me warmly and\ntook me back to see the brochures. They had decided to go ahead and run all of\nthe copies while they were on press; the paper was nice and the fold job was\nspot on. The printer’s work was stupendous!\n\nUnfortunately, as I would quickly realize, my work was the problem. I began\nskimming down the text on the front page and then I learned a valuable lesson:\nFAX is not spelled FZX! Now that I noticed the typo (after everything was\nprinted) I could not believe I had missed it before. How could I have let such\na grievous error slip by me? The cover consisted of a photo, the client’s\nlogo, and about ten words (FZX being one of them). Last time I checked, a ten\npercent typo rate isn’t going to win you any design awards. In the end, they\nreran the job and I ran out of their shop, tail between legs and all.\n\nSince this experience, I have become obsessed with proofing my work and the\nwork of others. In fact, one of my personal mantras is “OCD Is an Attribute.”\nI understand that OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) is a real challenge that\nmany people struggle with every day, and it is certainly not my goal to make\nlight of it. I am merely trying to point out that in graphic design you must\nobsess about the details. The placement of every pixel must be considered. No\ndetail must be left uncritiqued. No typo can be left unfixed. If something is\noff-center by the slightest degree, it can quickly become a visual\nabomination.\n\n![Image](../images/00025.jpeg)\n\nWe live in a world where computer software enables designs to be perfect—down\nto the smallest pixel and up to the largest print format imaginable. Error-\nfree design is not only possible but imperative to your profession and to the\nquality of your finished products.\n\nGreat graphic designers are typically great proofers. The core elements that\nshould be considered in a proofreading exercise include layout, typography,\nand color usage. Here are just a few questions you should ask yourself when\nreviewing any graphic design project:\n\n• Is there anything about the layout that can be improved?\n\n• How does the eye flow through the composition? Can you read the elements in\nthe proper order?\n\n• Examine the typography. Are there any typos (spelling and punctuation)? Have\nkerning, tracking, and leading been attended to with every possible detail? Is\nthe text ragged? Are there rivers? Widows? Orphans?\n\n• Are the elements that should be consistent, consistent? What about headers?\nButtons? Font usage?\n\n• Is anything out of alignment with the grid of the design?\n\n• Are there any tangents? Are there elements butting up against each other (or\na margin) that are visually awkward?\n\n• Does the color palette work? Could any of the colors be improved?\n\n• Have photos been appropriately treated to improve their visual quality? Has\nany cropping been cleaned up and utilized as best as is possible?\n\n• Do any photos or images appear to be grainy or low quality?\n\n* * *\n\nTHE\n\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN\n\nGOOD DESIGN\n\nAND\n\nGREAT DESIGN\n\nIS PAYING ATTENTION\n\nTO THE\n\nDETAILS.\n\n* * *\n\nThese inquiries, along with other related questions that you may come up with,\nmust become second nature to you. You must be able to look at a design and\nconsider these things almost without even knowing that you are doing so. As\nwith anything you want to get better at, you must practice, practice,\npractice.\n\nI’ve turned graphic design critiquing into a life game.",

It is fun to find errors in the work\ncreated by an unknown designer. You can bash them up and down, guilt free!\nEmbrace every opportunity you get to release your inner OCD, and remember that\nthe difference between good design and great design is paying attention to the\ndetails.\n\n\n## 24\\. Polishing Turds\n\nCreating a quality product is at the forefront of the long list of\nresponsibilities that designers face each time they step into the office. You\nhave to keep pushing yourself to get better and to take your designs to new\nlevels. Every project is a new opportunity to design an award-winning\nmasterpiece and an anchor portfolio piece.\n\nWhile most projects may start out with this grandiose mindset, the unfortunate\nthing about graphic design is that it can sometimes become more about\npolishing turds than creating the next _Mona Lisa_. Let me illustrate this\nwith a hypothetical example.\n\nClient X needs a logo designed for his landscaping company. You scour your\nfavorite design books for ideas. You click hundreds of landscaping websites\ntrying to get into the mind of the client and his customer. You even go so far\nas to buy a handful of landscaping magazines to really try to understand the\nindustry. You know in your very core that this is going to be the best logo\never!\n\nYour sketches look great and it is time to make some mock-ups. You parade them\nproudly around the office and everyone is in awe of your design abilities.\nYou’re starting to think that you just might be the best designer to ever walk\nthe face of the earth.\n\nYou send the logos to Client X for review. Of course you know that Logo Option\n4 is the obvious choice and that the client will definitely choose that one.\nYou anxiously await the client’s reply—they will certainly recognize and\nrejoice in your awesomeness. The phone rings; Client X is on the line.\n\n“We showed these around to the team and we weren’t really feeling any of them.\nOne of our guys showed me a font they have on their computer. It’s called\nComic Sans. It was really cool; kind of light-hearted, like our business. Can\nyou try that font on some logos in the next round?”\n\nYour heart sinks a little, but your competitive spirit kicks in and you decide\nthat you’ll really show them how good you are in the next round. You make a\nwhole new batch of amazing logos and you throw one in there with Comic Sans as\nthe font in an effort to appease your client. The other designers in the\noffice hail your greatness until they see the Comic Sans logo version, at\nwhich point they laugh and point. You try to explain yourself, but their\nlaughter continues.

The other designers in the\noffice hail your greatness until they see the Comic Sans logo version, at\nwhich point they laugh and point. You try to explain yourself, but their\nlaughter continues. You send the logos to Client X, confident that this time\nyou have hit it out of the park. Client X calls:\n\n“This round was much better. I think we are getting somewhere.

My wife loves the color purple and thought that would make\nthe logo stand out more. Oh, and my brother was telling me about this\nPhotoshop filter that can make things look beveled...kind of 3D. We think that\nwould be cool, too.”\n\nThis is the defining moment when your responsibility shifts from creating\nunique and high-concept designs to merely polishing turds. Obviously, in the\ncase of my hypothetical scenario, the client is asking for a turd. Your job is\nto turn it into the best looking turd it can be and then get that turd out of\nyour production pipeline as quickly as possible. At this point you must check\nyour pride at the door. Don’t spend countless hours trying to convince the\nclient why your logo ideas are better. Simply accept that the design is not\ngoing to be the masterpiece you were hoping for and polish it as best you can.\n\nDo what they ask. Polish that turd. Deliver it. And then thank your lucky\nstars that the project is over and you are free to move on to the next (and\nhopefully more harmonious with your design sensibilities) project in your\nqueue.\n\nRemember, though. Polishing turds does not mean that you abandon your design\nprinciples. If the client wants purple grass in their landscape logo, then use\nyour color theory expertise to choose the absolute best purple color possible.\nIf Comic Sans is their font of choice, then make sure that the kerning and\nleading are set to total perfection. If the client wants a little bevel and\nemboss on their logo, then use all the design finesse you can muster to make\nit just right. Make that turd the best and prettiest turd the world has ever\nseen, and remember that not every project is meant to be a masterpiece.\n\nUltimately, in spite of your goal to create the best designs in the world, the\nreality of the graphic design industry is that oftentimes you must create the\nbest design that your client will allow and work within the parameters they\nhave set—even if that goes against everything you know to be good and\naesthetically pleasing.\n\n![Image](../images/00026.jpeg)",

Hairy Moles\n\nMoles, freckles, birthmarks—they are all part of life. Nearly everyone has\nsome sort of skin abnormality somewhere on his or her body; it is simply the\nway we’re built. In some cases, a small mole right on the face is even\nconsidered a beauty mark, bringing to mind Marilyn Monroe and Cindy Crawford,\nto name a few. On the flip side, however, there is something visually\ndisturbing about a hairy mole. I doubt that Cindy Crawford would have had the\nsame success in her modeling career if she had a pile of hair pouring out of\nher mole. Sure, in her prime she was arguably the most beautiful woman in the\nworld. But a big hairy mole on her face would have drawn so much attention\nthat even the most lustful men in the world would probably not have been able\nto look past it.\n\n![Image](../images/00027.jpeg)\n\nIs this a superficial perspective? Perhaps. However, if you conducted your own\nindependent survey, I’m sure you’d find it to be true.\n\n“Hairy moles” exist not only in dermatologist offices but in graphic design as\nwell. When they appear, it makes no difference how amazingly beautiful your\ndesign is; your client won’t be able to look past the “hairy mole.” Let’s take\na look at a few of these hairy creatures:\n\n• The client requests a change that you don’t make. This is a great way to\nfrustrate your client. You have to make sure you review and satisfy all of\nyour client’s requested changes before submitting the next round of comps for\ntheir review.\n\n• You leave a broken link or image on a website. Your client will lose\nconfidence in you if they find even just one thing broken. They will likely\nthink to themselves, “Wow, what else could be broken?”\n\n![Image](../images/00028.jpeg)\n\n• The design contains an ugly logo. If so, chances are that it will drag down\nthe visual success of the rest of the piece. Imagine the _Mona Lisa_ with an\nerrant brush stroke in the bottom-right corner.\n\n• The project contains bad typography. Widows. Orphans. Rivers. Typos. You may\nhave an awesome layout, but if you don’t have stellar text to go along with\nit, the design can never be fully appreciated.\n\n• You’ve missed a deadline without communicating with the client. Even if you\nare just a few minutes late, you will have left your client waiting, and this\nis a huge issue. It may appear to be a little mole, but it is a hairy one and\nit detracts from the overall beauty of your client’s experience with you.\n\n![Image](../images/00029.jpeg)\n\nWatch out for hairy moles. Proof everything carefully. Graphic design is about\nthe details. The smallest detail left to chance can scar the success of any\nproject.",

    "chunk_full": "## 26\\. This Is Not Verbatimville\n\nVerbatimville is a land of thoughtless zombie drones who wander around like\nrobots doing exactly what they are told. Far too many graphic design\nprofessionals live their lives wandering in Verbatimville. When their client\nasks for a change, they do it exactly as they are told without utilizing their\nown knowledge of design principles or tapping into their design instincts. You\nwill never progress in your design abilities if you live your life stuck in\nVerbatimville. Your projects will never achieve their full potential if you\nsimply follow the mandates of your boss or client; you must instead move out\nof Verbatimville and into the land of Creative Genius.\n\nOne of the most embarrassing things ever produced at my company was due to a\nVerbatimville mindset. Our team was working on some banners for Warner Bros.\nIt was a great project and we were the preferred vendor for this group. The\nclient had delivered key art for the banners and we were instructed to use\nthat art in the banners. To this day I am not sure how our team could think it\nwas acceptable to send the banners they sent for client review. Due to the\nfile size requirements of the banners, the JPEG quality of the key art had to\nbe set to 10% or 15%. The results were banners with huge pixels and artifacts;\nyou couldn’t even tell what the images were supposed to be. These hideous\nbanners were sent to Warner Bros. with no explanation or comment. I can only\nimagine that our client was thinking, “What in the world are these? They look\nterrible!” And of course, some of our team members who live in Verbatimville\nwere thinking, “Well, you asked for the banners to be a certain file size. You\nalso asked us to use the key art you sent. As a result, the JPEG quality had\nto be set really low. Hope you like ‘em!”\n\nAlternatively, here is a safe approach to injecting your own creativity into a\nproject without offending your boss or client: Create one version that is\nexactly what they ask for, and prepare another version that is your better\nidea. Here is how the conversation goes when you reveal the comps:\n\n“Here is Comp A. We followed your suggestions and made the adjustments exactly\nas you requested.”\n\n(The client is satisfied that you followed their explicit instructions and is\nnot offended. This is the Verbatimville comp.)\n\n“And here is Comp B. As we were working on your requested modifications we had\nsome other design ideas come to mind. In this comp we implemented those ideas\nand feel that it is a strong option to consider because of... (fill in the\nblank here with whatever stellar and grandiose reasons you may have).”\n\n(The client is still satisfied with Comp A and is now also excited that you\nare going the extra mile and using your head. You win brownie points whether\nthey like your extra solution or not.)\n\nInevitably, there will be times that your client or boss will prefer Comp A.\nWhen that happens, please refer to the chapter “[Polishing\nTurds](part0032.html#ch024)” in this section of the book and move forward with\nthe knowledge that you offered up your best creative effort.\n\nThere are two other habits that the zombies of Verbatimville can’t seem to\nkick.\n\n**Not reading copy:** They will just copy and paste text as it is handed to\nthem. Next time, try reading the copy and make suggestions for improvement.\nReading the text will also help the designer to create copy areas that\nappropriately highlight key phrases.\n\n**Not treating photos:** This happens when designers settle for using photos\nexactly as they are provided. Next time, try opening up Photoshop and making\nnecessary adjustments to color, contrast, levels, curves, and so on. Usually a\nminute or two of enhancing a photo can make a dramatic improvement.\n\nIn order to progress in your design and production capabilities, you must\ncontinually ask yourself, what would make this better? Keep pushing yourself\nand refuse to assume that the idea you are provided with is always the best\nand only one. Inject your creativity into every project and remember, “This is\nnot Verbatimville.”\n\n* * *\n\nYOU WILL NEVER PROGRESS\n\nIN YOUR DESIGN ABILITIES\n\nIF YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE\n\nSTUCK IN VERBATIMVILLE.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 27\\.

Shock and Awe\n\nAll working designers know there are clients in any person’s Rolodex that seem\nto fight against great design no matter how much you try to convince them\notherwise. It only makes sense, then, that in the war against subpar design,\nthe Shock and Awe principle would apply just as it would on an international\nbattlefield. While we don’t advocate dropping massive bombs on your clients\n(in spite of the frustrations they cause you), we do advocate overwhelming\nthem with spectacular displays of design prowess that “destroy their will to\nfight” against you. If Shock and Awe is used properly, your clients will\nbecome putty in your hands, humbly submitting to your will and deferring to\nyour expertise.\n\n![Image](../images/00030.jpeg)\n\nHarlan K. Ullman and James P. Wade are credited with coining the term “Shock\nand Awe.” In their 1996 document “Shock and Awe: Achieving Rapid Dominance”\n(National Defense University and later authored by the U.S. Department of\nDefense), Ullman and Wade define four characteristics of rapid dominance:\n\n• _Near total or absolute knowledge and understanding of self, adversary, and\nenvironment_\n\n• _Rapidity and timeliness in application_\n\n• _Operational brilliance in execution_\n\n• _Near total control and signature management of the entire operational\nenvironment_\n\nLet’s take a look at each of these items and their application to the creative\nindustry.\n\n**Near total or absolute knowledge and understanding of self, adversary, and\nenvironment.** You must amaze your clients with your technical knowledge and\nyour understanding of their industry. They must have total confidence that you\nunderstand what they are looking to achieve and that you were the right choice\nto execute on their needs.\n\n**Rapidity and timeliness in application.** Clients should be dazzled by how\nrapidly you respond to their inquiries and how quickly the project takes\nflight. Your timeliness on all matters ensures that your clients are never\nwaiting on you and allows you to stay in control of the project from inception\nto final product.\n\n**Operational brilliance in execution.** Every time you send something to a\nclient, an effort should be made to blow them away, to exceed their\nexpectations. You must go above and beyond the call of duty in both design and\ntechnical execution.\n\n**Near total control and signature management of the entire operational\nenvironment.** You must have defined and methodical processes. Your\norganizational skills will put your clients at ease, as they will know that\nyou are in complete control of the project, deliverables, and all milestones.\n\nShock and Awe should be the goal of every interaction with your client in\nevery phase of the project. Here is a list of Shock and Awe recommendations to\nuse at various points in the project that can help you to begin dazzling your\nclients.\n\n_**While working to secure a client or obtain a green light on a potential\nproject**_\n\n• Send the client a basket of goodies or an unexpected gift.\n\n• Deliver a proposal sooner than expected.\n\n• Take a client to lunch or golfing.\n\n• Hand-deliver a printed and bound proposal (as opposed to an emailed PDF).\n\n• Include some exploratory comps in your proposal.\n\n• Provide a line-item discount reflecting charitable organization, friend, or\nvolume pricing.\n\n• If you work at a larger company, have someone from your upper management\nsend a personal note or email to the prospective client.\n\n• Since a project green light should initiate a rapid succession of events, a\nquick kickoff meeting or introduction to applicable team members is a great\nway to get the ball rolling fast.\n\n**_During the creative phase of a project_**\n\n• Provide more comps than the client expects. This could include variations on\na theme as well as completely new directions. For example, if the client is\nexpecting five logo ideas, send ten.\n\n![Image](../images/00031.jpeg)\n\n• If the project is a logo design, put the best logos in an environment (like\non the side of a truck or building). Also, with a logo design you could\ninclude business card ideas that correspond with the logo to demonstrate how\nthe brand could extend to marketing materials.\n\n• On a print project, include a printed mock-up that is folded to help\ndemonstrate what the finished product will look like.\n\n• When you have a face-to-face meeting, print the comps and mount them on\ngator board to leave them with the client. You could also bring a simple gift\nor goodie basket.",

Many clients are easily impressed by\ncontent that moves; creating interactive and moving elements can help bring\nthe project to life for the client.\n\n• You could add unexpected programming enhancements and features to the site.\n\n**_When a project is wrapping_**\n\n• Send in the final invoice under budget. Everyone loves it when something\ncosts less than expected.\n\n• Don’t charge the client for extra items they requested and anticipated\nhaving to pay for.\n\n• Send the client a gift basket or make another gesture to express your\ngratitude.\n\nAnd of course, in every phase of every project you should try to deliver ahead\nof schedule and exceed expectations through Shock and Awe techniques.\n\n![Image](../images/00032.jpeg)\n\n\n## 28\\. Art Is Meant to Be Framed\n\nHere are a few things I’ve learned over the years: Whipped cream topping on\nalmost every dessert will make it better. Melted cheese on top of almost any\nentree will make it better. Putting almost any piece of art in a frame will\nmake it better.\n\nI was waiting in line at a restaurant recently and I examined the photos\nhanging on the wall. Truthfully, the photos were not very good. I have taken\nbetter photos using my iPhone than the ones featured here. However, these\nphotos were showcased in a fancy wooden frame with a large white matte around\nthem. They were behind a shiny piece of clean glass, and the photographer had\nsigned the matte with an elegant script handwriting.\n\nMost people have wandered around an art museum at some point in their lives. I\nmyself have a minor in art history and have certainly been to my fair share of\ngalleries. Truth be told, there is a lot of supposed “art” out there that\ncouldn’t even be sold at a garage sale. But if you wrap the same piece of\n“art” in an ornate frame, place it in a museum with a fancy plaque under it\nalong with some spotlighting above, it could end up selling for millions of\ndollars.\n\nThis begs the question, why does this happen? You’ve likely heard the phrase\n“presentation is everything.” In graphic design, presentation is critical. You\ncould have designed the most amazing comp of your life, but if you just attach\na JPEG version of it to an email and click Send, you are missing an\nopportunity to have that design fully appreciated by your client. Many, many\ngood designers make this mistake. Steer clear of this error by taking every\nmeasure possible to control the display environment when showing your designs\nfor critique.\n\n![Image](../images/00033.jpeg)\n\nFace-to-face meetings to present your comps are the easiest. Print your\ndesigns. Mount them on black foam core. Design a little sticker plaque with\nyour logo on it and the project name. Attach the sticker to the back of the\nfoam core. Put it in a fancy case and off you go!\n\nDesign comps sent via the Internet are a little trickier to fancy up. The\nfirst secret is to never, ever email a comp.",

Put it in a fancy case and off you go!\n\nDesign comps sent via the Internet are a little trickier to fancy up. The\nfirst secret is to never, ever email a comp. You have no control over the\ndisplay when you email a design to a client. Some clients won’t even get an\nemailed attachment due to their server settings. You have to put the comps in\nan environment you can control. For every project, we create a web page that\nserves as a means of delivery for our comps (such as clickable proofs for\nwebsite projects). The menu page is nicely designed with our color scheme,\nlogo, and contact information. Every time we send something to a client for\nreview, we upload it to the server and update a link on the menu page. We then\nemail the client the menu page link and notify them that there are new things\nfor them to review. This is the first step to controlling the environment.\n\n![Image](../images/00034.jpeg)\n\nHere are a few other pointers for consideration when presenting your clients\nwith a new look:\n\n• Website comps should be placed in an HTML page with a background. Center\nthem if it is appropriate to the design. Make the background stretch to large\nmonitor widths if that is what the final design intention is. Make the website\ncomp look as “real” as you can; don’t just upload a JPEG and send the client a\nlink to the file.\n\n• Because print projects are tougher to send in digital format than their Web\ncounterparts, I recommend sending a PDF and JPEG file whenever possible. As an\nexample, the PDF version of a trifold brochure would be a multipage document\nof the flat brochure. The PDF version allows the client to zoom in, read the\ntext, and see even the most minute of details up close and personal.\n\n• For the JPEG version of a print project, take the front panel of the\nbrochure as well as an inside panel. Place them juxtaposed on the JPEG with a\nlittle shadow under the top one so that it looks like a photograph of the\nactual brochure. Make sure you design a simple little footer for the bottom of\nthe JPEG that includes your logo, name of the project, and date. The JPEG\nversion is there to help your client get a feel for what the finished product\nwill look like. You can’t rely on your client to be able to visualize the\nfinished piece when looking at a flat PDF. This same principle applies to\nother print design elements: business cards, letterhead, annual reports, and\nmuch more.\n\n• Be sure to send individual PDFs of your logo comps, with each logo on an\nindividual page. This allows the logos to be reviewed without competing with\none another as they would if they were all on the same page.\n\n• Logo projects are fun to “frame.” I recommend utilizing your fancy Photoshop\nskills to put the logos in a realistic environment. We’ve taken logo comps and\nplaced them on the side of a truck, on a celebrity’s t-shirt, on hats, on\nbuildings, and even on the sides of buses. I interviewed one designer who had\ncreated a logo for a hockey team; he superimposed the logo onto a photo of the\nclient’s ice rink. It looked sweet! The client can then truly visualize how\nthe logo will appear in a real world situation.\n\nGreat companies “get” this. Pay attention the next time you buy an Apple\nproduct. You’ve likely already noticed that their packaging alone is a classy\nand timeless work of art! It makes an already great product more exciting than\nthe packages waiting under the tree on Christmas morning.",

It Is Never Too Late for a Better Idea\n\nDuring our first six years, Warner Bros. was one of our most valued repeating\nclients. We’re proud to have them as a client and regularly bend over\nbackwards to satisfy their requests. On one occasion, a few of our designers\nhad some comps ready to send to them for a Web-related project. Toward the end\nof the day, we gathered in the conference room to review the comps. Tweety\nBird was the star of the critique and the overall design was spot on. However,\nas we reviewed the design in an attempt to assess usability, it was clear that\nthere was an issue with the navigation. I pointed out the issue and presented\na solution to the lead designer on the project. I suspect the design change\nwould have taken about 45 minutes to execute. His response:\n\n“Well, I agree that it is a better idea, but it is getting a little late in\nthe day so I think we should just send it.”\n\nI couldn’t believe my ears. You can’t retain Warner Bros. (or any other client\nfor that matter) by giving them second-rate design solutions. If there is a\nbetter idea, it absolutely needs to be executed. Time is rarely a viable\nexcuse for bad design. I intervened and mandated that the change be made.\n\nOf course, this type of thinking needs to be balanced against deadlines.\nDeadlines can’t be missed, and there are times when a design compromise has to\nbe made. If that had been the case in this example, the appropriate way to\nhandle the situation would have been a simple message in the delivery email to\nthe client, such as:\n\n“In our final team critique of the design, just before sending it per our\npredetermined deadline agreement, we came up with an additional navigation\nsolution. We wanted to make sure we hit our deadline, so we sent you what we\nhad at the time of our internal critique. We should have the alternate comp\nready for you tomorrow morning. On the new comp the design will largely stay\nthe same, but the navigation will change. We look forward to your feedback on\nthis and on the extra version that will arrive tomorrow.”\n\nThis message satisfies the client as well as the deadline. It also satisfies\nthe designer by giving them the extra time necessary to execute the change.\nYour clients are paying you to provide the best solutions possible; in order\nto fulfill your full measure of graphic design success, your creativity and\nexpertise must be infused into your projects regardless of the time of day.\n\nOf course, there does come a point in a project when you can’t go completely\nback to the drawing board. For example, when the comp phase of the project is\ncomplete and production begins, you should stick with the approved design and\nwork toward the execution of that particular plan.\n\nThe point I’m trying to make is that agreed-upon improvements generated in\ncritique meetings should be a priority for execution. You must always strive\nto produce the best work possible, and welcome suggestions for improvement\nwherever and whenever they come your way. It is never too late for a better\nidea. And as with the case of the Tweety Bird issue, that short 45 minutes was\nall it took to correct something that made all the difference in the world.\n\n![Image](../images/00036.jpeg)\n\n\n## 30\\.",

    "chunk_full": "## 30\\. Filler Failures\n\nAs designers, many times we find ourselves having to create designs prior to\nobtaining all necessary assets from the client. This requires that you use\nsome elements For Placement Only (FPO). Unfortunately, without question,\nsometime, somewhere in your career some FPO elements will end up in the final\nproduct. In a printed design they may actually go to press. In a website, they\ninevitably will be pushed to the live server. It happens; you are, after all,\nonly human.\n\nI learned this lesson the hard way. About a year into my career, I was waiting\non copy for a website I was creating. I was young and frustrated. I need some\nfiller text for the design, so I thought I’d vent a little. I began writing,\n“Why am I writing this copy? The client hasn’t provided me with the assets I\nneed to complete their project. This project is taking forever. I hope that\nthe client will give me assets soon...” Then I copied and pasted it over and\nover again to fill the space in the design. “Whew,” I thought, “that will show\nthem—of course I’ll be sure I put in the real copy before uploading the\ncontent to the live website.”\n\nThe next day the phone rang. It was the client. She said, “The design is\nlooking good, but what is this text in there? ‘Why am I writing this...’” She\nbegan reading the text I was sure she would never see. Then she began to chew\nme out and tell me how unprofessional this was. All I could do was hang my red\nface low and agree like a scorned dog. Since that day, I have never made the\nmistake of using inappropriate FPO content.\n\nI’ll spare you the story of when one of my employees pushed some FPO copy that\nincluded a swear word live onto one of the high-traffic kid sites we created\nat Fox. Fortunately, our internal team caught the error immediately and made\nthe correction. I suspect that employee has never made that mistake again,\neither.\n\nThe point is you can never be too cautious when using FPO elements. At some\nunexpected time, the client will see your placeholder text, guaranteed. Here\nare some thoughts on how to best avoid an uncomfortable mistake with FPO\nelements.\n\n**Use actual copy.** Whenever possible, use actual copy and images. If the\nclient has not provided you with content, take a look at their current\nmaterials (either in print or online) and see if you can find some assets to\nuse as FPO elements there. We also recommend taking a stab at creating\nheadline text if the client hasn’t provided any. Numerous times our team has\ncome up with headlines and taglines that the client falls in love with and\nactually uses in the final design.\n\n**Use Lorem Ipsum.** If you absolutely have no assets from the client, you\nmust use Lorem Ipsum text, the placeholder text used in publishing and graphic\ndesign. My favorite place to grab Lorem Ipsum text is\n[www.lipsum.com](http://www.lipsum.com). Please keep in mind that just because\nyou are pasting in filler text doesn’t mean you don’t have to design the text.\nYou must check for rivers, widows, orphans, and such, just like you would do\nwith any other typographic design you create. Also, so that it doesn’t look\nexactly the same in every part of the design, be sure to copy and paste\ndifferent portions of the filler text into your design.\n\n**Use appropriate material.** When using placeholder images, be sure to choose\nthings that are appropriate for the brand. Recently, I saw an employee at our\nagency reusing FPO screenshots of cartoon design work we’d previously created\nfor a major university and placing them in a new project. This was a huge no-\nno because the FPO images, though appropriate for the university, were not\nappropriate to the new brand they were representing. In other words, FPO\nimages should also be “designed” for each project. Be sure they are cropped\nproperly and adjusted for levels and contrast. Bad FPO image usage can scar a\ngreat design and keep a client from recognizing the greatness behind a\ncomp—even if the design is the greatest thing since the invention of the\niPhone.\n\n**Use a gray box.",

We’ve actually had clients ask us, “What is all that text in the\ndesign? I can’t read any of it!” You can never assume that the client knows\nthat they are looking at placeholder elements. A simple explanation in your\ndelivery email usually will suffice. (It may seem like overkill, but I\nrecommend that you even explain what “FPO” means if you have the acronym\npasted all over your design.)\n\nFinally, always assume that whatever elements you are designing with will\nsomehow make it to your client’s eyes...or even worse, make it into the final\n“live” design. Choose placeholder elements carefully so that you don’t have\nyour own “scorned dog” experience.\n\n![Image](../images/00037.jpeg)\n\n* * *\n\nCHOOSE PLACEHOLDER\n\nELEMENTS CAREFULLY\n\nSO THAT YOU DON’T\n\nHAVE YOUR OWN\n\n‘SCORNED DOG’\n\nEXPERIENCE.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 31\\. A River Runs Through It\n\nIf I added up the hours spent removing one of the two spaces that people put\nafter periods in their text, I’d find that I have probably frittered away more\nthan a few days of my life. Honestly, I’d like to have that time back, so I’m\nwriting an official complaint to the world.\n\n**Period - Space - Space - New Sentence**\n\nPerhaps you were taught this way in grade school typing class. It is time for\nyou to abandon this practice. Stop immediately. You are wasting my time.\n\n**Period - Space - New Sentence**\n\nThis is how you do it, regardless of what your typing teacher taught you. You\nare a graphic designer. Your job is to make the text look nice. Two spaces\nafter a period will cause visual grief almost every time.\n\nAs Wikipedia explains, the two letter spaces came from 19th-century typewriter\nuse where the typewriter’s monotype spacing was not sufficient to separate\nwords for readability and legibility purposes. To get around this issue,\ntypists simply added the extra space. It then become commonplace to type those\ntwo spaces between all sentences. Generations of 20th-century typists were\ntaught this technique during typing class, a lesson that would prove hard to\nunlearn as times would change.\n\n![Image](../images/00038.jpeg)\n\nToday, where proportional fonts assign proper spacing, that second space in\ntwo-letter spacing creates too much space. The issue persists because\ntraditional typists continue the practice of adding two spaces, whether out of\nhabit, of not knowing any better, or from a stubbornness to change.\n\nTo complicate matters further, there is even an ongoing debate as to which is\ncorrect, double or single spacing, with each side claiming readability and\nlegibility of their supported convention is best. Studies have even produced\nwhat are claimed to be inconclusive results as far as each side is concerned.\n\nTruthfully, I am not overly interested in the historical reason that people do\nPeriod - Space - Space - New Sentence. In graphic design, visual decisions\ntrump nearly all other decisions. This should be reason enough for a graphic\ndesigner. Two spaces after a period makes your text prone to rivers. Two\nspaces after a period will leave awkward gaps in body copy. Two spaces after a\nperiod will create visual issues with ragged copy. Text is a visual element\nand must be designed along with all the other visual elements in your design.\nPlease discontinue the practice of Period - Space - Space - New Sentence\nimmediately. (See how annoying all those weird gaps are?)",

Comps or Comprehensive?\n\nThere is a rampant misunderstanding in the graphic design industry about what\nthe word _comp_ stands for; however, it is likely that every graphic designer\nunderstands a _comp_ to be essentially a draft version or mock-up of a design.\n\nMy own disorganized and random survey results clearly show that most of you\nwho are reading this are under the mistaken assumption that the word _comp_ is\na derivative of the word _composition_. While it is easy to see where this\nconfusion comes from, the word _comp_ is actually a short version of\n_comprehensive_ or _composite_. Although the word _composition_ stems from the\nsame Latin root word as the words _composite_ or _comprehensive_ , there are\nsmall differences in their definitions that can make big differences in your\ndesign. And the difference in definition between _composition_ and\n_comprehensive_ may explain why there are so many bad _comps_ submitted by\ngraphic designers throughout the world.\n\n![Image](../images/00039.jpeg)\n\nThe word _composition_ is defined by dictionaries as an act of arranging parts\nor elements to form a whole in artistic form.\n\nThe word _comprehensive_ is defined by dictionaries as a detailed preliminary\nlayout of an advertisement that shows placement of photographs, illustrations,\nand copy.\n\nWhen it comes to synonyms, [Thesaurus.com](http://Thesaurus.com) reveals that\nthe word _composition_ includes synonyms such as structure, layout, design,\nform, symmetry, and balance, all of which are important words when considering\nyour design.\n\nSynonyms of the word _comprehensive_ include all-inclusive, exhaustive,\nextensive, full, lock stock and barrel, the big picture, the whole shebang,\nand widespread, words that more closely match the true meaning of _comp_.\n\n![Image](../images/00040.jpeg)\n\nConsider for a moment what comes to mind when you hear the _composition_\nsynonym—layout—versus the _comprehensive_ synonymous word—extensive. Or\nconsider the _composition_ synonym—design—against the _comprehensive_\nsynonymous phrase—the whole shebang. Is it no wonder why so many designers\nproduce unrefined and sloppy _comps_?\n\n![Image](../images/00041.jpeg)\n\nEvery _comp_ that a designer sends to a client should be as polished and\nfinished as humanly possible. Every detail should be considered in an effort\nto help the client easily envision the finished product.\n\n![Image](../images/00042.jpeg)\n\n\n## 33\\. Design Like the Wind\n\nA client of ours called the other day and needed us to make a change to the\nwebsite we had created for them several years before. Our business development\ndirector called the appropriate production team member and asked how long the\nrequested task would take. “Should take about an hour, but I’m slammed for the\nnext six weeks with this other project,” was the reply. We were floored. Over\nthe course of six weeks, this team member could not find one spare hour of\nproduction time to execute the small change? There are 14,400 minutes in a\nsix-week time period. All that our business development director needed was 60\nof them. This response showed that this team member didn’t realize that we all\nwaste time throughout the day. The five seconds here and there that are wasted\nin each of our days really add up over time.\n\n![Image](../images/00043.jpeg)\n\nIf you save five seconds per minute, then you’ll save 300 seconds (or 5\nminutes) per hour. That’s 200 minutes (or 3.33 hours) per 40-hour workweek, or\n173.16 hours (or 7.215 days) per 52-week year, or basically a week-long\nvacation to the destination of your choice! (Or better yet, if everyone on a\ntwelve-person design team saves those precious seconds and we multiply those\nseconds by a billable rate of $100 per hour, we just found an extra $207,792\nof annual revenue!)\n\nOne of the former art directors at our company is ambidextrous. He uses a\nWacom Tablet with his left hand, a mouse with his right hand, and places a\nkeyboard in the middle. And boy can he can crank out fast work! Unfortunately,\nnot all of us have the luxury of being ambidextrous, but there are several\nplaces where we all can save five seconds (or more) per minute. Here are a few\nideas.\n\n**Learn keyboard shortcuts.",

Unfortunately,\nnot all of us have the luxury of being ambidextrous, but there are several\nplaces where we all can save five seconds (or more) per minute. Here are a few\nideas.\n\n**Learn keyboard shortcuts.** One of our fastest production team members seems\nto know every keyboard shortcut. He isn’t the best designer. He isn’t the best\nprogrammer. But his speed in executing production tasks makes him one of our\nmost critical team members.\n\n* * *\n\nTHE FASTER YOU WORK,\n\nTHE MORE MONEY YOU MAKE.\n\n* * *\n\n**Batch tasks.** Organize your day to clump related tasks together. For\nexample, you could check your voicemail three times per day instead of every\ntime you receive a call. Depending on your role in the company, perhaps you\ncould check your email in batches as well. Do all your Photoshop work at once\nand then focus on the programming tasks. Work on only one project at a time.\nBy focusing on one task at a time, you save valuable seconds that are lost in\nswitching tasks.\n\n**Reduce clutter.** If you have piles of junk on your actual desktop and\nhundreds of files on your virtual desktop, you are wasting valuable seconds\neach time you go to locate a file or a piece of artwork. By being organized\nwith tangible as well as digital items, you find things faster, keep your head\nclearer, and save time.\n\n**Take regimented breaks.** Get up and take a break. If you are anything like\nme, the longer I sit and work, the more frazzled my head gets. By getting up\nand taking a quick break, you can clear your head and be more productive when\nyou sit back down.\n\nIf you are really in crunch-time mode, make sure your breaks are regimented.\nKeep an eye on the clock and instead of taking a 15-minute break, take a\n14-minute break...60 seconds found!\n\n**Put on headphones.** If you are in an open-area work environment, wearing\nheadphones can drown out ambient noise and help you focus on the tasks at\nhand. Additionally, your team members are less likely to bother you if you\nhave headphones on, whether you are actually listening to music or not.\n\n**Skip the water cooler.** It is easy to waste time by engaging in everyday\noffice banter. Honestly, every production environment I’ve worked in\n(including at my own agency) has idle time of probably 20 percent or more of\nthe day, with team members sharing stories, opinions, viral videos, jokes, and\nother unproductive wastes of time. I usually don’t frown on it, and—in my\nmind—I typically chalk it up to team building, which is important for\ncreativity. But, if the workload is heavy and deadlines need to be met, it is\ntime to focus; skipping these types of office activities can save much more\nthan five seconds per minute.\n\n![Image](../images/00044.jpeg)\n\n**Tell people you’re slammed.** If you’re rushing to hit a deadline, make sure\neveryone knows it. Sending out a friendly message to the team such as, “Just\nwanted to let you know that I am super busy today trying to hit a deadline.\nYour assistance in helping me stay focused is appreciated,” can help deter\nyour teammates from engaging you in the usual interoffice distractions.\n\n**Ask for help.** If you’re really scrambling to find time to hit your\ndeadlines, ask for help. There is a good chance that some of your teammates\naren’t as busy as you are, and can find some time and ways to help.\n\n**Get an egg timer.** I’m not opposed to busting out an egg timer to keep\nmeetings and tasks on schedule. It’s amazing how much faster we work when we\nrace against a literal clock.\n\nThere are countless books written about time management and productivity. If\nyou are really interested in optimizing your day, head to the local bookstore\nand grab a few.

If\nyou are really interested in optimizing your day, head to the local bookstore\nand grab a few. Some of my favorites are written by author David Allen,\nincluding the very popular book _Getting Things Done_.\n\nThe graphic design industry is a deadline-oriented business. We all have\nmoments where every second counts, whether it is trying to find 60 minutes in\na six-week period, or five minutes at the end of the day in order to hit a\ndeadline. Effective usage of time is the key to success, and if you are a\nfreelancer, time is money. The faster you work, the more money you make.\n\nFinally, it doesn’t matter if you are the best designer in the whole world; if\nit takes you ten times too long to get your work done, it will be difficult\nfor you to succeed in the deadline-driven and fast-paced graphic design\nindustry. Optimizing your production speed is critical to becoming the best\nall-around designer you can be.\n\n![Image](../images/00045.jpeg)\n\n\n## 34\\. Type Fast\n\nI have interviewed hundreds of people throughout my career. One of the\nquestions I like to ask a potential production employee (designer or\nprogrammer) is, “How fast a typist are you?” Typing speed is typically an\naccurate gauge of production speed. The faster someone types, the faster they\nwork. This is true of almost every production artist I have seen throughout my\ncareer.\n\nIf someone cares about becoming a fast typist and has obviously worked toward\nthat goal, they likely have worked to become fast at other things. They likely\nuse a lot of keyboard shortcuts. They likely have strategies that optimize\ntheir time. They likely will produce quality work at a higher rate than the\nguy sitting next to them. Time is money in graphic design; finding people who\nwork quickly and accurately is critical to running a profitable organization.\n\n![Image](../images/00046.jpeg)\n\n\n## 35\\. How to Eat an Elephant\n\nWhile there may be many ways to skin a cat, there is really only one way to\neat an elephant: one bite at a time.\n\nWhen our agency green lit a kid’s project to create an interactive world with\ngames and activities for one of Pepsi’s highly recognized brands, we were\nexcited. The only challenge we foresaw was the timeline. This was a giant\nproject with a six-figure budget, and they wanted it to be completed in eight\nshort weeks.\n\nThe task ahead of us was to create an interactive universe and three distinct\nworlds (one for each flavor of the product line). Each of the three worlds was\nto include custom animations, a unique game, a trivia quiz, and four custom-\nillustrated coloring book pages. To top it off, we would need to create an\ninteractive section for parents that provided information about the product\nand nutritional facts.\n\nWith a universe, three worlds, three unique games, three interactive trivia\nquizzes, and twelve custom-illustrated coloring book pages, plus a full-blown\nproduct section to create in just two months, we knew that a wishy-washy\napproach to execution was not going to enable us to eat this elephant. We had\nto get detailed and organized on this project or else we knew it would blow up\nin our face on day 55.\n\n**Select the team.** The first thing we did was determine the people we would\nneed on the project. We chose a team of seven people to dedicate from our\ncompany: myself as project manager, an art director, a designer, a programmer,\nan illustrator/animator, a production artist, plus someone to manage the\nclient throughout the process. We also utilized our office manager for odds\nand ends support, writing some of the copy, research, and quality assurance.\n\n![Image](../images/00047.jpeg)\n\n**Break down the elephant into bite-sized pieces.",

The Venus Initiative\n\nWhen our agency was relatively new and growing, we felt it necessary to assess\npotential areas of improvement and further growth; we did this by analyzing\nthe core components that we felt determined our success as a design company.\nThese areas were profitability, client satisfaction, and quality of work.\nDuring these early years of our company, we were operating at over 50 percent\nprofitability, and we had a constant stream of praise and unsolicited\nreferrals coming from our clients. But we had never been published in a\nnational magazine such as _Communication Arts_ , and we had not felt ready to\nsubmit many designs for award consideration, either. While our work was\ncertainly “good,” we wanted it to be “great,” and we determined that the area\nof “quality of work” was the element that most needed our attention moving\nforward.\n\nOur best designers got together to figure out some systems to better enable us\nto achieve high-quality design and maximize collaboration. We created a\nprocess that we endearingly titled “The Venus Initiative,” appropriately named\nafter the Roman goddess of beauty and love.\n\nOver time, this process has become more organic in our organization, and these\nelements happen without the formality of structured meetings. However, the\nprinciples we put in place years ago are still key to effectively arriving at\nhigh-quality work and can be implemented in your process as well, in whatever\nmanner works the best for your organization. Here is our quality of work\nimprovement process from start of a project to near delivery to the client.\n\n**1\\.",

Art Director Kickoff**\n\n**_Who Attends:_** Assigned design team and art director (sometimes business\ndevelopment team members who brought in the project are involved, as well)\n\n**_Summary:_** After a project is kicked off within the organization, the art\ndirector will meet with the assigned design team to discuss the general\ndetails of the project.\n\n**_Objective:_** Ensure that the design team has all of the information for\nthe project. This includes:\n\n• Client objectives\n\n• Client’s design style (direction)\n\n• Details about what the project entails\n\n• Target audience\n\n• Understanding of what assets are available for use\n\n• Understanding of what content should be included on each element of the\nproject\n\n• Understanding of the timeline\n\n• Understanding of the budget (how much production hours can be spent)\n\n**_Deliverable:_** An assigned attendee should take notes and distribute the\ninformation to the other attendees for reference throughout the course of the\nproject.\n\n**2\\. Define the Barometers**\n\n**_Who Attends:_** Assigned design team\n\n**_Summary:_** Prior to the meeting, the assigned design team will perform\nresearch to find projects similar to the assigned project. The research should\ninclude websites, design magazines, design books, and any other appropriate\nsource. Each team member brings their proposed example designs to the meeting\nfor discussion with the group.\n\n**_Objective:_** Establish a set of example designs to serve as inspiration to\npush our designs to match in quality. The example designs are referred to as\nbarometers, and these designs are used as reference points throughout the\ndevelopment process. Please note that the barometers are not copied, but\nmerely used as a benchmark for quality to determine a level of polish in the\nfinished design piece.\n\n**_Deliverable:_** The barometers should include at least one but as many as\nfive comparable projects/designs from the researched sources. These designs\nare added to a project folder or digital production tool depending on the\nagency’s internal production management systems.\n\n**3\\. Thumbs Up Meeting**\n\n**_Who Attends:_** Assigned design team and art director\n\n**_Summary:_** This is the meeting where a lot of conversation and\nbrainstorming should occur. The assigned design team will brainstorm design\nconcepts and create thumbnail sketches for internal review. The thumbnails\nwill include concept ideas and layout/grid ideas. The thumbnails will be\ndiscussed in a Thumbs Up meeting that includes the art director and assigned\ndesign team. The pros and cons for each thumbnail are then analyzed for each\nsketch that is presented.\n\n**_Objective:_** Determine the concepts and layout or grid to be implemented\ninto the first comps.\n\n**_Deliverable:_** The assigned design team should have at least twice as many\nthumbnails as expected at first comps (that is, if three first comps are\nexpected to be submitted to the client, the assigned design team should\npresent at least six thumbnail sketch ideas). As a group, the assigned team\nwill collaborate with the art director to decide on which thumbnails are to be\ndeveloped into the first round of comps.\n\n**4\\. Battle of the Bands**\n\n**_Who Attends:_** Assigned design team and other individuals not assigned to\nthe project\n\n**_Summary:_** Designers and nondesigners meet to review and discuss the comps\nprior to submission for internal approval. This should be a full-blown school-\nstyle critique where questions are asked and answers are given (think back to\nyour college days, minus the frat parties, cute coeds, and ping-pong wars as\ndistractions).

The designs should be heavily scrutinized and pushed so as to\nachieve maximum quality. The phrase, “that looks good to me,” should rarely be\nused in this phase of critiquing; the focus should be on “what if” questions.\nWhat if we did this for this piece of the design? What if you did something\nlike this site...? The tone from all participants should be, how can we make\nthis better? And it shouldn’t matter how good the original submissions may be;\nthink like there should always be room for improvement.\n\n**_Objective:_** Scrutinize the designs and develop a detailed list of\nimprovements to be made.\n\n**_Deliverable:_** Assigned design team takes critique feedback and revises\ncomps accordingly in preparation for the “Wow Meeting.”\n\n**5\\. Wow Meeting**\n\n**_Who Attends:_** Assigned design team, art director, and other company\nmanagement team members depending on the structure of the organization\n\n**_Summary:_** The assigned design team presents their first comps for\ninternal approval. This meeting should occur at least one day prior to the\nscheduled delivery to the client so that any final internal changes can be\nimplemented.\n\n**_Objective:_** Gain internal approval/feedback prior to the submission to\nthe client. Based on the processes implemented prior to this meeting, the\nassigned design team should have a level of polish to the work that makes the\napproval team members say, “Wow,” rather than this meeting becoming another\nall-out critique of the comps.\n\n**_Deliverable:_** Internal approval with occasional final changes requested\nfrom management.\n\nIt is surprising how unstructured many design organizations are. In graphic\ndesign and art schools, the classrooms are often filled with gray walls and\ndesigns are regularly posted for classroom-sized critiques. But in most of the\ncompanies I’ve worked at (including my own), this step is omitted in an effort\nto race through production and hit the deadlines. In these cases, the quality\nof work suffers. Parts (or all) of The Venus Initiative can be assimilated\neasily into a design organization in a streamlined fashion, enabling\nconsiderable improvement in work quality to be achieved practically overnight.\n\n![Image](../images/00051.jpeg)\n\n\n## 37\\. Process-a-Palooza\n\nThe transition from freelancer to agency owner was filled with adjustments. It\nseemed like we were scaling a mountain and had to continually change our\ntactics to keep progressing. When I first started hiring employees at my\nagency, we changed the production process every couple of weeks (much to the\nlament of my team). We were growing so fast that it seemed with every new\nemployee we needed to tweak the process to allow things to keep working and to\nfind the system that offered the most benefit to the particular team and\nproject; what worked for a team of three with ten projects didn’t necessarily\nwork for a team of five with twenty projects.\n\nTo implement an optimal system, one of the things we found to be important is\nto have a defined process of tracking and executing on projects. Here are a\nfew project management process ideas to track and execute that I’ve used at\nvarious phases of my career.\n\n![Image](../images/00052.jpeg)\n\n**Process 1: To-Do Lists**\n\nNothing revolutionary here, and it worked well as an independent freelancer,\ntoo. Get out a piece of paper. List the things you need to do and cross them\noff when they are complete. (There is no shortage of digital “To-Do List”\napplications if you choose to go that route.)\n\n**When to Use:** This system is easy to implement and works well if you are a\none-person show managing just a few projects.\n\n**Process 2: Inbox**\n\nOnce I started working out of my email Inbox years ago, I haven’t stopped.\nSimply email yourself tasks that you need to complete. Once a task is\nfinished, file or delete the email.",

Once a task is\nfinished, file or delete the email. It is an easy way to track your tasks.\nMost of us keep regular tabs on our email, which inevitably helps you track\nthe things you need to do.\n\n**When to Use:** This system is best for an independent freelancer with a\nsmall quantity of projects, but, as I have demonstrated in my own life, it is\nan excellent tool for large businesses and executives as well.\n\n**Process 3: Dry Erase Board**\n\nDuring the dot-com era of the late nineties, I was creative director over a\nsmall team creating one of the first interactive kid worlds on the Web. The\nCEO of the company would call me every morning at about 7:30 A.M. and I’d walk\nhim through the site and the things we launched the day before. The Internet\nindustry was going crazy at the time and we were in a race to get to market\nfast. We had lofty goals of launching large amounts of new content each day.\nOur process was simple: We listed all of the things we had to create and\ncomplete on a dry erase board; when a team member completed one item on the\nlist, they would go to the board, cross it off, and write their name beside\nthe next item they were going to tackle. Everyone loved the system because it\nwas simple and allowed for some freedom inside the design team to decide which\nitems they wanted to take on.\n\n**When to Use:** This is a simple and scalable process that works best when\nthere are many team members of a similar skill set working on one large\nproject together.\n\n**Process 4: Job Folders**\n\nThe first little design shop I worked at used this system, and I replicated it\nduring a few brief stints of my career at other companies. Each project gets a\nfolder (anything from manila envelopes to clear plastic job jackets can work).\nEach folder contains a piece of paper detailing the project scope. The job\nfolders represent responsibility. The team member who holds the folder bears\nthe responsibility to oversee and execute on the project. As the project\nprogresses through a development team, the job folder passes from team member\nto team member to execute on their respective pieces.\n\n**When to Use:** A process like this works well in a print-heavy design\nenvironment. The job folders allow for easy archiving of proofs of the printed\nwork and it is easy to document the project scope on paper, since scope\nchanges are not as prevalent in print as they are in interactive projects.\nHowever, this type of process can work successfully in production environments\nthat have interactive media projects as well.\n\n**Process 5: The Furnace**\n\nI love this process because my mind naturally works this way. I’ve used it in\nseveral phases of my career to manage a production team and large quantities\nof projects. You need a large dry erase board (or something similar). Divide\nthe board into columns (most office supply stores carry thin black tape for\nthis type of thing). You’ll need one column for each of the phases your\nprojects pass through. The following phases are pretty consistent with the\nmajority of production environments I have seen throughout my career:\n\n• Estimate\n\n• Awaiting the Green Light\n\n• Concepting\n\n• 1st Comps\n\n• Awaiting Feedback\n\n• 2nd Comps\n\n• Awaiting Feedback\n\n• Final Comps\n\n• Awaiting Approval\n\n• 1st Build\n\n• Awaiting Feedback\n\n• 2nd Build\n\n• Awaiting Feedback\n\n• Final Build\n\n• Awaiting Approval\n\n• Launch/Deliver\n\nNow create a “project card” equal to the width of each column for each of your\nprojects (perhaps it is a 3″ × 5″, or you could use Post-it notes or something\nsimilar).",

Then simply put each project into the column that corresponds with\nthe phase it is in. Your goal is to move each project card through each phase\nuntil the project is completed.\n\n**When to Use:** The Furnace process is a great way to get a global view of\nworking projects. It also provides an easy way to run a production meeting as\nyou discuss each project with the team, asking, “What needs to happen to move\nthis project to the next column?”\n\n**Process 6: Digital Systems**\n\nDigital project management tools are commonly used and work miracles in\nhelping creative teams collaborate on projects. We successfully execute on\nprojects in collaboration with people all over the world by utilizing digital\nproject management tools.\n\nOur agency uses Basecamp® ([www.basecamphq.com](http://www.basecamphq.com)),\nbut there are many other options available, each with its pros and cons. If\nyou are interested in utilizing a digital tool to manage your projects, do\nyour research and pick the one that seems right for you.\n\n**When to Use:** Digital project management tools are best for companies with\nlarger teams managing numerous projects. Digital systems often scale easily to\nhandle 10 to 100 simultaneously running projects. Most of them come with a\nmonthly fee, so they are best used if you are with a company or working full-\ntime as a freelancer where the consistency of your workflow makes it worth\nspending the money each month.\n\n\n## 38\\. Hiking Your Way to Successful Projects\n\nMy oldest son is in Boy Scouts. It seems there is never a shortage of campouts\nscheduled for these young men. Each campout is organized with some sort of\nhike involved, and in an effort to be a good father I attend all of them with\nhim. He loves it. I, on the other hand, love being with him...and therefore\nsuffer through the hard ground and sleepless nights that sleeping outdoors has\nto offer. When it comes to camping, I feel like I have served my sentence. You\nsee, I grew up camping and hiking with four brothers and no sisters. It wasn’t\nuntil I was an adult that I realized the reasons my parents took us hiking and\ncamping on EVERY vacation. First, it didn’t matter too much when their\nrambunctious boys broke things in a forest. And second, if they hiked us\naround all day we might actually fall asleep at night.\n\nIn hiking there are a few formulas to help you successfully reach your\ndestination. I have some experience with many of them. It wasn’t until\nrecently that I realized the correlation between hiking strategies and\nproduction environments. Let’s analyze the correlation between three types of\nhikes and their corresponding production environment. The goal of each is to\narrive successfully at the destination. In hiking, the destination is\nobviously a location. In a graphic design production environment, the\ndestination is a successful project (one that is completed on time and that\ndelivers above and beyond the client’s expectations in all aspects of the\njob).\n\n**Category #1: It’s over there...**\n\nMany of the hikes I’ve been on fall into this category. A park ranger or\nsomeone “knowledgeable” points into the forest and says, “The destination is\nthat way.” The hiking party ventures off into the forest in the general\ndirection they signaled in hopes of finding the location. Oftentimes, they\nwill arrive at the destination, likely after a few wrong turns and backtracks.\nSometimes, they will get totally lost and find their way back to where they\nstarted. And, unfortunately, other times the hikers end up lost in the forest\nfor good.",

And, unfortunately, other times the hikers end up lost in the forest\nfor good.\n\nMost production environments operate this way—kind of “willy-nilly.” In an\neffort to arrive at the destination of a successful project, the business\nowner or salesperson will turn over the project to a production team and say,\n“It’s over there...good luck!” The production team will then scramble through\nthe project, hoping to blindly feel their way to success. A designer may head\nin the wrong direction for a time...perhaps their boss or client will get them\nback on track. There may even be some missed deadlines. Frequently this type\nof production style leads to frustration for both the production team and the\nclient, and far too many design teams operate like this on a daily basis.\n\n**Category #2: The guided tour...**\n\nHikes with an experienced guide can be great fun. You pack your stuff and then\nmindlessly follow behind the guide as they make all your decisions for you.\nThe guide knows exactly where the destination is, and all you have to worry\nabout is turning, climbing, and descending when and where they say. Many times\nthey even hook up ropes for you and tell you exactly where to place your foot.\n\n![Image](../images/00053.jpeg)\n\nThese types of production environments can operate very successfully. All you\nneed is one superstar who knows how to arrive at a successful project every\ntime, with every client. Usually that person is in an art director or creative\ndirector role. They wander around the office calling the shots for every\nproject. I’ve been this person in several production environments. It may\nsound like bliss for the designers in the world who don’t want to have to make\ntough decisions, but the reality is that it is frustrating to everyone. The\ndesign team gets sick of being told what to do all the time. The superstar\ncreative director starts wondering why nobody can think for themselves. And\nwatch out if that superstar ever gets sick or takes a vacation. The whole\ncompany could fall to pieces! To top it all off, this is not a scalable\nstrategy. If your company begins to grow, eventually there will be a limit to\nthe number of projects and people your superstar employee can manage\neffectively.\n\n**Category #3: The detailed map...**\n\nThe best chance for a successful hike is having a detailed map, created by\nsomeone who knows the area and that is used by people who know how to read it.\nImagine a map for a blazed trail with documented mile markers and signs\npointing the right direction at every split in the path. These types of maps\noften contain invaluable advice about pitfalls to watch for, how much water to\ncarry, and how long it takes to traverse each part of the trail. It doesn’t\ntake a rocket scientist to find the way to a destination with these tools. In\nfact, millions of direction-challenged people find their way to amazing\ndestinations every year using these detailed maps.\n\nDocumented processes, created by someone who knows what they are doing, are\nthe safest way to operate a successful production environment. I’m not talking\nabout a simple process—green light the project, make website, bill client,\nrepeat. Many companies operate with things like this in place and “think” they\nhave a production process. I’m talking about a very detailed and organized\nflow for each type of project you do. Only by digging into the nitty-gritty\ndetails of what exactly needs to be done can you be assured that you, or other\npeople in your production environment, will not forget to act on important\npieces of the project. At our agency we have a set list of To-Do items that\ncorrespond with each project.",

Solving End-of-Day Rush\n\nWhen I started my design agency, the first few people I hired were junior\nemployees. Admittedly, I was afraid of the burden of a higher-paid employee\nand took financial comfort in a low-cost solution. As we began to grow as a\nbusiness, our employees grew in their skills as well. They had earned the\nopportunity for promotion as we began hiring more junior employees. Now we had\njunior employees managing junior employees. What we quickly realized was that\nthese new managers were staying late and struggling to complete their work on\ntime. The end of the day became a mad scramble. The junior employees would\noften be twiddling their thumbs while the junior managers were pulling their\nhair out trying to wrap up the projects for the day.\n\nUltimately, we found ourselves in the midst of a delegation issue. The junior\nmanagers had just barely figured out how to manage their own projects and now\nwere in a position where they had to help others manage their workload, too.\nWe issued a document and gave our junior managers some training to help\nalleviate this problem.\n\nThe document was called “Management Strategies to Alleviate End-of-Day Rush”\nand it was founded on the principle that a manager should do what only they\ncan do and then delegate the rest. As a manager, you must clearly define your\nrole and delegate nearly all other elements to keep all the cogs turning\nsmoothly. The following are a few tasks that can typically be delegated to a\njunior member of the team to help alleviate stress at the end of a workday.\n\n**Prewrite delivery emails.** Have a production team member write your emails\nand then send you the copy early in the day. We recommend that you have\nstandard formulas for most email types, as it is always easier to adjust\nexisting copy than to write it from scratch. By writing these emails early, it\nis easier to be detailed and organized. If you wait till the end of day they\nusually come out rushed. Also, it is a great way to create a “task” list for\nyourself and feel the accomplishment of completing a task by being able to\ncomplete the email later in the day with the final links. It is very important\nthat you don’t fill in the “To” and “Cc” email addresses until just before you\nsend the email (usually toward the end of the day) just in case you\naccidentally click Send.\n\n**Create lightboxes.** If you need stock photos for a project, get one of your\nproduction team members to create the lightbox for you. They could even email\nyou a link to the lightbox. You can select the photos you want and have the\nproduction team member download them and place them on the server for you.\n\n**Download client assets or upload files.** Have a junior team member download\nfiles from the FTP sites or upload project files for delivery. This is a time-\nconsuming process that can be easily performed without manager assistance.\n\n**Perform the collection and verification of assets.** Delegate these\nprocesses that include consolidating things on the server, creating “clean”\nversions of assets (such as merging key art layers, cloning and extending\nbackgrounds, and so on), and reducing assets to the proper dpi (if projects\nare Web/interactive based). You could also delegate the task of collecting and\norganizing client copy.\n\n**Start a new project the day before it is slated to begin, if not earlier.**\nHave someone on the team do this step even if this means simply getting the\nPhotoshop document open, piling assets into it, and then closing it until the\nproject launch date; this can have a huge effect on reducing stress levels.\n\nWhile it may not apply to delegation, setting a personal deadline for yourself\nto complete your daily tasks earlier than the end of day helps alleviate end-\nof-day stresses. Push for 4:00 P.M. instead of viewing 6:00 P.M. as your\ntimeline for completion. Then you can spend from 4:00 P.M. to 6:00 P.M.\nworking on projects that are due the next day to help you get ahead of the\noncoming train.\n\nThe real trick to reducing workday stress is to delegate, delegate, delegate.\nBy spreading the production tasks across a team, everyone can complete their\ndaily work on time and with minimal stress.",

    "chunk_full": "## 40\\. Why Projects Blow Up\n\nEvery year we have a project or two that blows up in our faces. The client\nfreaks out. Our team gets fed up. The budget quickly gets way too small and\nthe scope becomes way too big. Sure, the client’s obvious lack of\nunderstanding and integrity usually has something to do with it, but I’m not a\nbig fan of pointing fingers. I always look at myself first, asking, what could\nI have done to mitigate this disaster? Without exception the answer comes\nback: Don’t skip the details at the start. Every disaster project for every\ndisaster client in my entire professional career could have been alleviated by\ndoing a better job of breaking down the details at the start of the project.\nSkip this step, and you will be headed for trouble.\n\n![Image](../images/00055.jpeg)\n\nA designer often wants to jump right in and start doing the fun part: the\nartwork. “Who cares about the exact specifications! We’ll figure that out\nlater.” This mindset has caused me more grief in my career than any other\nbehavioral disorder I have. “Design” is not the first step to a project. A\ncareful, organized, detail-gathering phase is always step one.\n\nOftentimes, in an effort to achieve a quick green light, our proposals are too\ngeneral. For instance, a client approaches you about creating a brochure. You\nwrite up your proposal and happily send it to the client with a line and price\nthat clearly states that you will “Create a corporate brochure to promote\nClient X’s company.” In order to land the project, sometimes you may have to\nbe a bit vague in your proposal, which is fine. Just don’t start designing the\nbrochure until you get a fully detailed scope of work agreed upon with the\nclient.\n\n“Create a corporate brochure to promote Client X’s company” must be broken\ndown to include details like these:\n\n• Trifold brochure\n\n• 8.5″ × 14″\n\n• Six panels\n\n* * *\n\nEVERY DISASTER PROJECT\n\nFOR EVERY DISASTER CLIENT\n\nIN MY ENTIRE\n\nPROFESSIONAL CAREER\n\nCOULD HAVE BEEN\n\nALLEVIATED\n\nBY DOING A BETTER JOB OF\n\nBREAKING DOWN THE DETAILS\n\nAT THE START OF THE PROJECT.\n\n* * *\n\n• 4/4 color printing (full color on both sides)\n\n• No stock photo purchases (client will provide photos)\n\n• No copywriting (client will provide copy)\n\n• No printing (client will pay for printing directly to the printer)\n\nThis type of simple detail will ensure that you have some ammunition to push\nback to the client when they tell you things like, “I thought stock photos\nwere included in your price,” and “I actually was thinking the brochure would\nbe bigger and have 12 panels.” Without detailing out the specifics of the\nbrochure, you are left only with your interpretation versus their\ninterpretation of what the project is—in this situation, the client will\nalways win because they hold your paycheck in their hands.\n\nThis same strategy applies to all types of graphic design projects, from logos\nto brochures and signage to websites. Every project needs to be clearly\ndefined at the start to safely mitigate the chance of an explosion at some\npoint in the future.\n\nBe sure to define these items whenever appropriate:\n\n• Sizes\n\n• Concept\n\n• Features\n\n• Functionality\n\n• Wireframes\n\n• Site maps\n\n• What is included\n\n• What is not included\n\n• How many rounds of changes\n\n• How long the project will take\n\n![Image](../images/00056.jpeg)\n\nSkipping these details can spell disaster. It’s all about using great detail\nto get on the same page as the client, and then managing their expectations\nthroughout the course of the project.",

    "chunk_full": "## 41\\. The Lo-Fi PDA\n\nI will preface this chapter by saying I am a HUGE technology fan. I’ve owned\nevery version of the iPod. I could write “graffiti” on my Palm with the best\nof them. I overcame an addiction to the Blackberry scroll wheel only to\nreplace it with a finger-swipe addiction to my iPhone. Suffice it to say, if\nit is made out of aluminum and has an Apple logo on it, I already own it or I\nam going to own it soon. In my digestion of all this technology over the years\nI’ve learned a valuable lesson: There are some things that are just better on\npaper.\n\nAt our company, everyone is issued a “Lo-Fi PDA” to go along with their state-\nof-the-art, hi-fi smart phone. The Lo-Fi PDA is nothing more than a fancy name\nfor a notebook. We are big fans of the Moleskine® Legendary notebooks\n([www.moleskine.com](http://www.moleskine.com)). Having a Lo-Fi PDA and a pen\nhandy everywhere you go empowers you in the following ways.\n\n**Emptying your psychic RAM.** David Allen, a renowned productivity expert,\ndiscusses “psychic RAM” in his 2000 book _Ready for Anything_. Your mind, like\na computer, has RAM, and as you go about your day your RAM fills up with\ninformation. As your brain tries to store and organize all of this\ninformation, it can get overloaded—much like opening too many windows and\napplications can bog down your computer RAM.\n\n_“Something will ‘bug’ you until you’ve clarified your intention about it,\ndecided how to move on it, and put reminders of the outcome and action in\nplaces your mind trusts that you’ll see as often as you need to and at the\nright time._\n\n_The solution is simple. Write it down. Look at it. Do it or say to yourself,\n‘Not now.’ And trust that you’ll see the option again whenever you need to\nreassess. Give it to a system superior to your mind, so your mental energy can\nmove on to its bigger and better work.”_\n\n—Ready for Anything, _2003, 26–27_\n\nFor me, the “system” he recommends is my Lo-Fi PDA. I almost always have it\nwith me, usually even by my bed. I can’t count the number of times I’ve woken\nup in the wee hours of the morning, careful not to wake my wife, and written\ndown things that were stirring in my “psychic RAM.” I quickly write down my\nimportant thoughts or the task I don’t want to forget, and because I know I’ll\ncheck my Lo-Fi PDA again in the morning, I can relax and fall back to sleep.\n\n**Speedy note taking.** I will go head to head with nearly anyone when it\ncomes to taking notes in my Lo-Fi PDA versus a smartphone. I’m not talking\nabout a full-size keyboard. I’m talking about me with a pencil versus someone\nwith a thumb-sized keyboard. As great as they are, smartphone keyboards just\ndon’t allow you to jot things down as fast as a pencil and paper.\nAdditionally, a creative person’s note-taking style is often riddled with\nsketches and doodles. It is a challenge to take notes like this on a\nsmartphone.\n\n**Drawing.** While smartphones and other devices are making strides in\nproviding capable drawing functions, they are not yet an adequate substitute\nfor a pencil or pen and a pad of paper. The Lo-Fi PDA is the perfect place to\nquickly sketch out design ideas, wireframes, thumbnails, storyboards, or even\nlogo concepts. Graphic design is a visual world; having a place to take visual\nnotes is essential.\n\n**Looking interested.** Take your Lo-Fi PDA to every meeting. By jotting\nthings down in a meeting, you appear interested in what people are saying.\nEven better, the nature of taking notes in a meeting will help you focus on\nwhat someone is saying and will help you actually become interested. This is\ncritical in client meetings or in meetings with people higher up the org\nchart. You write down things they say. They feel important. You gain trust and\nappreciation.\n\nThe Lo-Fi PDA can benefit you in many ways; I’ve named just a few. Don’t get\nme wrong: I believe in technology. But technology hasn’t yet adequately\nreplaced the good old pen and paper in everything.\n\n![Image](../images/00057.jpeg)\n\n\n## 42\\.",

I’m a total rock star!”\nWhen a project goes awry, we tend to point fingers at the client and say\nthings like, “They don’t know what they are doing” or “This client is a total\nidiot, and doesn’t know anything about design.” I’ve had all those thoughts\nthroughout my career. Heck, I think I had all those thoughts last week alone.\nNone of these thoughts will help you achieve better results in future\nprojects.\n\n![Image](../images/00058.jpeg)\n\nThe only way to truly grow in your ability to execute projects successfully is\nto learn something new every time. One of the only ways to guarantee that you\nwill accurately analyze each project is to have a postmortem meeting.\nTraditionally, a postmortem refers to the examination of a body after death. A\ndoctor will dissect the body and its organs to determine cause of death and\nmake other medical assessments. By performing postmortem reviews, doctors have\nmade significant discoveries that have led to great progress in medicine.\n\nAfter each project is complete, put on your lab coat and grab your scalpel; a\ncareful dissection of the cadaver is in order. This simple agenda will help\nensure that you are learning from your experiences and not making the same\nmistakes over and over again. Below is a look into our medical examination\nprocess.\n\n**Postmortem Agenda**\n\n• Project Name\n\n• Success Rating (1=disaster, 10=heavenly)\n\n• What we did right\n\n• What we did wrong\n\n• What we will change\n\nTake notes and keep a log of all of your postmortem meetings. Put them in a\nplace where everyone on your team has access to them to make sure that others\ncan learn lessons from your experiences. Dig deep and be brutally honest with\nyourself when answering these simple questions.\n\n![Image](../images/00059.jpeg)\n\nWhen analyzing the project to discover “what we did right and wrong,” be\ncareful not to be vague in your answers. Here are a few examples that present\na good usage versus a bad usage of the postmortem experience. For this example\nlet’s suppose that the project was a complete disaster. The client hated\neverything you did, and you ended up giving them all their money back in hopes\nthat you will never see them again.\n\n**Bad Usage Example**\n\n_**Postmortem Agenda**_\n\nProject Name: Bait and Tackle Shop Website\n\nSuccess Rating (1=disaster, 10=heavenly): 1\n\n**_What We Did Right/Wrong:_**\n\nThis project blew up because the client didn’t understand what it takes to\nbuild a website.\n\n**_What We Will Change:_**\n\nDon’t work with bad clients who know nothing about web design.\n\nThe above example highlights the fact that the client was clueless. Great; we\nall knew that. A better use of the postmortem evaluation would be to create a\nlist of characteristics of a clueless client and then create some changes in\nyour process to ensure that you are not caught off-guard by a clueless client\nin the future.\n\n**Good Usage Example**\n\n**_Postmortem Agenda_**\n\nProject Name: Bait and Tackle Shop Website\n\nSuccess Rating (1=disaster, 10=heavenly): 1\n\n**_What We Did Right/Wrong:_**\n\nThis project blew up because the client didn’t understand what it takes to\nbuild a website. Here are some specific things that happened that identify a\npotential problem client:\n\n• The client asked a ton of questions.\n\n• The client was condescending in their tone of voice.\n\n• The client cut the price and scope of the project three times before giving\nthe green light.\n\n• The client seemed unwilling to put time and effort into making the project\nsucceed.\n\n![Image](../images/00060.jpeg)\n\n**_What We Will Change:_**\n\nDuring the proposal phase of the project we will watch out for the attributes\nabove that can identify a problem client. If we see these attributes, we will\nhave a heart to heart with the client and make sure they are on board with\nworking toward a successful finished product. If we feel that the client will\nbe a problem client, we will cancel the project before it starts.\n\nHere are two examples of bad and good usage for a postmortem on a successful\nproject that can help you repeat that success.",

The goal is to figure out how to replicate Josh’s success on the\nlogo.\n\n**Good Usage Example**\n\n**_Postmortem Agenda_**\n\nProject Name: Car Wash Logo\n\nSuccess Rating (1=disaster, 10=heavenly): 9\n\n**_What We Did Right/Wrong:_**\n\nThis project was a huge success. Josh designed a great logo and was on the\nsame page with the client. Here are some of the key things that Josh did that\nhelped him get into the client’s head and get to know what they wanted for\ntheir logo design:\n\n• Developed concept sketches presented to the client prior to doing design\nwork.\n\n• Called the client to discuss the concept sketches in detail.\n\n**_What We Will Change:_**\n\nWe are implementing a requirement that every logo project includes a phase of\nconcept sketches prior to beginning the design work.\n\nA postmortem review on every project that comes through your doors (whether\nthe project was a massive success or an epic failure) can help to ensure that\nyou don’t repeat bad experiences and that you do all you can to duplicate the\ngood ones. These meetings don’t have to be long or overly formal; something as\nsmall as a few minutes learning from the past can make a world of difference\nfor the future.\n\n![Image](../images/00061.jpeg)\n\n\n## 43\\. Shake the Bushes or Get Bit\n\nI grew up on a lake by a forest in northern Indiana. My wife once likened my\nupbringing to that of the Dukes of Hazzard—a comparison that was only slightly\noff. Catching snakes was a pastime for my four brothers and me. We would spend\nthe day in the forest with a can and a stick hunting for our slithering\nfriends. We were afraid of the rare but poisonous Massasauga rattlesnake that\nwe had convinced ourselves roamed the area looking for little boys to corner\nand bite. The can we brought with us was used to collect the snakes. The stick\nwas used to shake the bushes and underbrush to scare snakes out of hiding.\nWhen the snakes slithered away from the bushes, we could see if it was a scary\nrattlesnake or the harmless garter snake we were after.\n\nFortunately, none of us were ever bitten by a rattlesnake. But in business, I\nhave been bitten many times when I forgot to first shake the bushes before\nmoving forward. All too often we will jump into a project too quickly without\nfleshing out all the details. As a designer, you often want to get right into\nthe fun part—designing. The temptation is too great to skip the extremely\nimportant detail-finding phase, and instead of hitting your project with a\nstick, you decide to reach your hand into the bush, which might get you\nbitten. In fact, nine times out of ten, when a project blows up, we can route\nit back to something that would not have happened if we had been diligent in\nfleshing out all of the details at the start of the project.\n\nAt the beginning of each project, our team has a Kickoff Meeting with the\nclient.",

This meeting can be face-to-face or over the phone; either way can be\nsuccessful. Prior to the Kickoff Meeting, we send our client the agenda.\n(IMPORTANT: We prefill _all_ the information we know to date about the project\nprior to sending it to the client. You never want to create more work for your\nclient, and chances are good that you may have already uncovered a good chunk\nof this information during your proposal process.)\n\n![Image](../images/00062.jpeg)\n\nOur Kickoff Meeting Agenda includes the questions outlined below (again, with\nas many answers as possible prefilled in). Your agenda may be different; what\nis important is that you dig deep and ask all of the questions you can think\nof regarding the upcoming project.\n\n**Kickoff Meeting Agenda**\n\n**_Project Overview_**\n\n• What are the deliverables for this project?\n\n• What is the demographic of your target audience?\n\n• Who are your biggest competitors?\n\n• What are the objectives of this project?\n\n• What are you trying to resolve?\n\n• What factors would make this a successful project?\n\n• What concerns do you have regarding this project?\n\n**_Creative Overview_**\n\n• What are some adjectives that describe the “look and feel” you desire for\nthe end result of this project?\n\n• Do you have existing marketing materials that we need to match for brand\nconsistency?\n\n• What colors and fonts work well (or have been used in the past) for your\nbrand?\n\n• Name two or more brands or companies in your industry or a related industry\nthat have a “look and feel” similar to your desired end result for this\nproject. List their website addresses.\n\n• What are some brands you dislike in your industry or related industry? What\ndo you dislike about their brand?\n\n• What types of photos or other imagery should be used to represent your\nbrand?\n\n• What assets will be available from you for this project? When and how will\nthey be delivered?\n\n**_Technical Overview (Internet-related projects)_**\n\n• What is the server environment for this project?\n\n• Who is the technical contact on your side?\n\n• If known, what scripting and database languages are available on the server?\n\n• Does this site connect to any other websites or technologies (any important\nthird-party technologies such as Flickr,\n[salesforce.com](http://salesforce.com), RSS Feeds, YouTube, Payments\nGateways)? If so, who can provide access to those elements?\n\n• Are there technologies or frameworks that you require to be used in the\ndevelopment of this project (like PHP, ASP, WordPress, ExpressionEngine,\nDrupal, CodeIgnitor, MooTools, jQuery, Zend, Kohana)?\n\nFollowing the Kickoff Meeting with the client, we send them a fully completed\nCreative Brief that contains answers to all of the questions regarding the\nproject. The information extracted at Kickoff is invaluable in executing a\nsuccessful project and ensures that everyone is on the exact same page moving\nforward, no hidden snakes and no poisonous bites to haunt you down the road.\n\n\n## 44\\. Red Flags and Extinguishers\n\nThe term _red flag_ is commonly used in businesses to identify that “there is\nsmoke in the air, and where there is smoke there is fire.” Something has\nhappened that indicates a possible impending disaster. In graphic design there\nare plenty of red flags to watch out for. A few years ago, I got sick of\nmaking the same mistakes over and over again, and began to recognize red flags\nin the design industry. I created some documentation for our company for each\nphase of production that highlighted these red flags; each one was accompanied\nby a form of documentation to help put out the subsequent fire.",

I created some documentation for our company for each\nphase of production that highlighted these red flags; each one was accompanied\nby a form of documentation to help put out the subsequent fire. We call those\nprotocols “extinguishers.”\n\n![Image](../images/00063.jpeg)\n\nEvery client is different, and every problem has its own nuances. The\nextinguishers are not guaranteed to put out the fire, but they are a great\nplace to start. The following are a few red flags that we have identified in\nour company, as well as the steps we take to deal with them when they rear\ntheir ugly heads.\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client cannot provide clear\ndirection as to what they want you to do. They don’t have an RFP (request for\nproposal).**\n\nYou meet with the client. They are excited about the “big idea” they have.\nWhen you begin to dig into the details, however, they aren’t clear on what\nthey want you to create for them. If they cannot paint a clear picture at the\nstart of the project, there is a good chance that they will change scope many\ntimes during the project, causing you a nightmarish project management\nexperience.\n\n**Extinguisher A:** If you get a sense that the client is going to be a flake,\ndon’t spend too much energy on helping scope out their project for them. A\nsimple request can flush out this type of client, such as, “Client, this\nproject sounds amazing. We can see your passion behind it. In order for us to\nbe able to accurately attach pricing to your project, we’ll need some type of\nRFP. A simple email detailing out all of the elements that you want us to\ncreate will help us immensely. Once we receive that, we’ll put together some\nnumbers for you.” This approach will either force them to clarify their\nrequest or expose them as the flake you don’t want to do business with. Either\nway, it puts the ball back where it belongs: in their court and not in yours.\n\n**Extinguisher B:** Sometimes your gut will tell you that the project is legit\nand the client could be on to the next big thing. If you feel strongly that\nthe client’s inability to pinpoint the scope of their project is just because\nthey need your help in all aspects (including creating the scope), then by all\nmeans, offer your help. You could get the ball rolling by saying something\nlike, “Client, we’re excited about your project. In order for us to accurately\nprovide an estimate, we’ll need to define the scope of work a bit better.\nBased on our conversation, we will create a scope document and send it to you\nfor your review. Once we lock down all the details, we’ll convert the scope\ndocument into a formal estimate.”\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client does not respond to emails\nor phone calls regarding questions about the project.**\n\nThe client pitches you a project. Everything seems to be great at the start\nbut communication goes cold as soon as you start asking questions.\n\n**Extinguisher:** Don’t be like the needy boyfriend or girlfriend who calls\nevery five seconds until they get in touch with the one they love. If the\nproject is pressing and the client is truly interested in having you do the\nwork, they’ll be in touch. Wait a few days or a week from the time of your\nlast contact and then call all the contact numbers you have for the client and\nleave messages if necessary. Then send one final email. (You have to be sure\nthat your correspondence gets to them and is not left in an email junk bin.)",

The client scrutinized our proposal,\nand requested additions and changes to many parts of it. After a month had\npassed and eight rounds of proposal revisions were implemented, we finally\nreceived the exciting green light to begin work. Three rounds of comps\noutlined in the proposal turned into more than 15 rounds of comps during the\nproject’s lifecycle. The proposed six-month project ended up taking nearly a\nyear to complete. We learned that additional rounds of proposals usually lead\nto additional work for everything else.\n\n**Extinguisher A:** After a few rounds of proposal changes, consider adding\nextra rounds of comps to the scope of work. This way you will anticipate what\nis likely coming in the project lifecycle and be prepared for that at the\nbeginning rather than being surprised by it in the heat of the moment.\n\n**Extinguisher B:** Don’t come down on your price. Stick to your guns if the\nclient begins to haggle the proposed cost. If they are asking for extra\nproposals, they will likely expect additional things during the project as\nwell.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client does not confirm receipt of\nproposal.**\n\nYou send the proposal and never hear from the client again. Generally\nspeaking, people are notorious for poor email etiquette, so not replying to\nyour proposal submission may not be the end of the road, but it is certainly\nsomething to watch out for.\n\n**Extinguisher:** If a client goes silent after they receive your proposal,\nthere is a good chance they are sticker shocked or have other concerns about\nthe project. First, you have to make sure they received your proposal, so\nfollow up via phone and email until you have that confirmation. Then offer\nyour desire to resolve any concerns they may have. You could say something\nlike, “Client, now that you have our proposal we feel we have some talking\npoints. We can rework the scope of the project to accommodate the budget you\nhave in mind. If you have other concerns that are keeping you from pulling the\ntrigger, let’s discuss those as well.”\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client balks at the price outlined\nin proposal.**\n\nYour proposal is sent to the client and they come back to you saying, “Whoa,\nthat seems a bit high!”\n\n**Extinguisher A:** Now that they have your price, you are justified in asking\nwhat their desired budget is. You can then offer to modify the scope of the\nproject to fit within their target price range.\n\n**Extinguisher B:** Educate the client. Oftentimes the client has no real\nunderstanding of what it takes to execute on their request. Something very\ncomplex may seem very simple in their eyes. Spend a few minutes to explain the\ncosts to the client; a brief write-up that details the time, tasks, and\ntechnical elements involved will help the client gain a better understanding\nof what it takes to complete their project.\n\n**Extinguisher C:** Make a decision internally as to whether or not the\nproject is worth doing at a lower cost. Some projects have more than just\nmonetary value at stake. Perhaps the project is for a charitable cause.",

If the scope is changing all the\ntime, you will be trying to hit a moving target throughout the duration of the\nproject.\n\n**Extinguisher A:** Be sure you have a detailed scope of work listed in your\nproposal. If the features the client is requesting are not included in the\nscope of work, be sure to politely remind them that the agreed-upon scope was\nin the proposal. If they want to modify that scope of work, you will need to\nreaddress the costs in the original estimate and submit a revised proposal.\n\n**Extinguisher B:** Clients that change scope are usually better off in a\n“Retainer” or “Dedicated Resource” payment structure. Explain these options to\nyour client and recommend that they change their agreement with you to reflect\nthat payment scale.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client wants to delay making the\nfirst payment on the project.**\n\nTypically you should charge some money up front to get started on a client’s\nproject. If a client wants to put off making a first payment and you begin\nwork on their project, brace yourself for getting stiffed down the road.\n\n**Extinguisher A:** If your gut tells you that you are at risk of being\nstiffed, trust it. Tell the client that you need to put the project on hold\nuntil the first payment is received.\n\n**Extinguisher B:** We have a number of big clients with deep pockets, and for\nwhatever reason it usually takes a little time to get an invoice through their\nAccounts Payable system. If you are spending a lot of hours on the project and\nthere seems to be an unreasonable delay, you have every right to check on the\nstatus of payment. Be courteous and kind, asking questions like, “Client, I\njust wanted to follow up on the status of the first payment for our project\ntogether that has come due.”\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client does not like any of the\ncomps.**\n\nThey may say something to the effect of, “These are all terrible. I’m just not\nfeeling it on any of the comps.”\n\n**Extinguisher A:** Remind the client that you have multiple rounds of comps\nfactored into the project. The comp rounds are there so that you can get\nfeedback and make changes to eventually land on the best design for their\nproject. The best thing for them to do is help guide you in the direction they\nenvision—even something so small as a font used that they like or an angle\nthat catches their eye can go a long way toward helping you piece together\nsomething that matches with their vision for the project.\n\n**Extinguisher B:** Don’t let the client get away with blanket statements\nlike, “I don’t like anything.” This type of feedback is not helpful. Sit down\nwith the client and discuss specifics. Ask specific questions about what they\ndon’t like: layout, colors, fonts, and so forth. The more detailed you are,\nthe better.",

When\nthey show you those examples, ask specific questions about what they like\nabout the designs.\n\n**Extinguisher D:** As great as you are, you may not be able to please some\nclients. When this happens, I usually chalk it up to a problem with them, not\nme. If you have not been able to hit the mark after utilizing these\nExtinguishers and have gone through a couple rounds of comps with the client,\nthey may be “unpleaseable.” Don’t be afraid to break ties with the client and\npart ways; this may include painfully returning monies previously paid, and\nmaybe even taking a loss on the project in order to get it smoothly and\nsuccessfully off of your books and out of your hair.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client wants to make changes to\npreviously approved items.**\n\nImagine that you are designing a website. After you receive design approval,\nyou move on to the build-out portion of the project. When you unveil the first\nclickable version of the site, the client makes a request to change the\ndesign. This type of behavior from a client can quickly make a project spin\nout of control. It is critical to handle it properly to ensure that a\nprofitable one-month project doesn’t become an unprofitable six-month\nheadache.\n\n**Extinguisher A:** Explain to the client that design changes at this phase of\nthe project will require reprogramming certain items. This will require the\ndeadline to be pushed back, as you will need to add an additional round of\ncomps and reprogram the entire site. Be careful not to become argumentative\nwith the client, however; your tone should continue to be service-minded and\nyour goal should always be a happy client.\n\n**Extinguisher B:** In every proposal you should include a line that states,\n“Changes to approved designs during the production phase of the project\n(prepress or programming) may require an extension of the timeline and an\nincrease in the budget.” By including this text in your proposal, you will be\nmore empowered to discuss the ramifications of a design change late in the\ndevelopment cycle of a project.\n\n**Extinguisher C:** If additional costs are agreed upon with the client, be\nsure to send an official “Change Order” for formality’s sake. Additional costs\nshould always be documented for the client to ensure there are no\nmisunderstandings when it comes time to bill for the work.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client has personal or family money\ninvested in the project.**\n\nA project that is being funded by personal or family money is prone to\ndramatic overreactions and sensitive client behavior.

We visited their office and found that they were sharing space\nwith four other companies. They talked big and acted as if they had money.\nWhen we broke down their project, we found that they were in need of\nredesigning nine brands and nine accompanying websites. We expected that they\nwould have a tight budget, so we strategically spelled out a way that we could\nreuse website programming for all nine sites to save them money. Instead of\n$10,000 per site plus the branding work, we landed on a total price of $36,000\nfor all nine brands and nine websites. We sent our “great deal” proposal to\nthe client and they responded by saying, “Wow! This is pretty expensive!\nYou’ll have to come down on the price.” We went back to the drawing board and\nsent a revised proposal with a decreased scope of work. The new price was\n$25,000 to which they replied, “Still too much.” We couldn’t make it any\ncheaper without losing a lot of money on the job and we decided to part ways.\nWe wasted a lot of hours in meetings and writing proposals because we didn’t\npay attention to the obvious red flag: “If the client doesn’t have an office,\nthey might not have any money, either.”\n\n**Extinguisher A:** Do everything you can to find out the client’s budget\nbeforehand (see the chapter “[How to Flush Out a Budget](part0097.html#ch086)”\nin [Section 5](part0089.html#part05)).\n\n**Extinguisher B:** Send a proposal with various scope and pricing options.\nCome up with a plan that offers a low-cost solution, a mid-range solution, and\na high-cost solution.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00064.jpeg) **Red Flag: Client has an unrealistic\ndeadline.**\n\nThe client wants their project done in a timeframe that is extremely tight, or\neven impossible.\n\n**Extinguisher A:** Clearly explain to the client everything that needs to be\ndone in order to hit the timeline.",

The goal is\nto “sell” a specific product, service, or brand. However, sometimes you will\nbe approached to create something for a client that is their entire business.\nFor example, an e-commerce website that has no brick-and-mortar counterpart is\na red flag project. If what you build doesn’t work due to the design or\nprogramming, then the client’s business will not work. These types of projects\nare red flag projects, not necessarily for problems that will result but\ninstead because they require extra effort and attention on your part to ensure\ntheir success.\n\n**Extinguisher A:** You must have a firm understanding of the client’s\nindustry and business model. Several client meetings can ensure your\nunderstanding. Do plenty of comprehensive research to make sure that what you\ndesign and build will work in the competitive landscape.\n\n**Extinguisher B:** Don’t underbid the project.

Brainstorms Are 90 Percent Bad Ideas\n\nBrainstorming with a group is an effective way to generate ideas. John gets an\nidea from something Sally says. George gets an idea from John. Eventually the\nteam lands on something truly amazing. When our creative team sits down to\nstart brainstorming ideas, you will often hear the reminder that “brainstorms\nare 90 percent bad ideas.” The 90-percent bad-idea rule applies to even the\nbest creative minds I have worked with over the years. In order to get to the\n10 percent of good ideas that are generated in a brainstorming session, you\noften have to muddle through the bad ideas. Imagine Indiana Jones slicing\nthrough the thick jungle brush, searching for the one trail that will lead to\nthe rope bridge and—ultimately—the lost treasure.\n\nIf you don’t understand this point of view, brainstorming can be an emotional\ndowner where you end up feeling like every idea you have gets shot down by\nyour peers. In reality, you should have the mindset that every bad idea you\nthrow out is a stepping stone to the good ideas that are waiting to be\ndiscovered. This point of view will keep your ego in check while the chaff\nthat is the bad ideas is separated from the golden wheat that is the next\ngreat idea.\n\n![Image](../images/00065.jpeg)\n\n\n## 46\\. The Communal Brain\n\nI’ve been in more high-octane brainstorm sessions than I can count. One in\nparticular, though, stands out to me. While I was working at Fox, our design\nteam leaders had a meeting with the marketing folks. Among other things\ndiscussed was a tagline to be used for one of our properties. The brainstorm\nmelee swirled around us until one of the design team members spouted out the\nphrase that would end up becoming the tagline for the next several years. The\nonly problem was that one of the marketing team members took credit for it.\nThe reality is that no one would probably have come up with the idea if it\nweren’t for everyone else in the brainstorm meeting helping to direct the\nthought line toward the ultimate winning tagline.\n\nBrainstorm ideas belong to the group. When people get together to share ideas,\na “communal brain” emerges. John gets an idea from something Sally says. Sally\ngets an idea from something Tracy says in jest. Tracy gets an idea from\nsomething Jim doodles on a scratch pad. The “communal brain” is really the\nowner of all of the brainstorming ideas, allowing everyone in the group to\nshare in the satisfaction that they contributed to the great ideas that were\ngenerated.\n\nWithout this mindset, potential squabbles can arise in a team about who really\ncame up with a big idea. While the “mine is bigger than yours” mentality may\nbe a perk to some occupations (perhaps professional sports and combat\nsituations), it is better for all involved in a collaborative and creative\nsetting to step off their soap boxes and swallow their pride. In the design\nrealm, every designer, regardless of status or ability, is better off\nrecognizing that the great ideas generated in a brainstorm meeting happen only\ndue to the contribution and collaboration with others when they all tap into\nthe power of the “communal brain.”\n\n![Image](../images/00066.jpeg)\n\n\n# Section 3: Two Ears, One Mouth\n\nSOMETIMES A CREATIVE PROFESSIONAL WILL ACTUALLY HAVE TO TAKE OFF THEIR\nHEADPHONES AND INTERACT WITH ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.\n\n\n## 47\\.",

The Ultimate Email Formula\n\nThe majority of our work comes from clients that are outside of our local\narea, and the majority of our growth comes via referrals from happy clients.\nIt stands to reason, then, that the majority of our communication goes by way\nof email, and thus expertly crafted emails are critical to relationship\nsuccess.\n\nEmail writing is a dangerous thing. It can be so easy for the email recipient\nto misinterpret the tone of your message, unless you make a clear effort to\ndefine the tone. The best thing to do is keep things friendly and\nlighthearted, and get to the point.\n\n**The Ultimate Email Formula is simple...**\n\n**(Message subject)**\n\n_This is the “Subject” field in your email application._\n\n**(Recipient name)**\n\n_This is “whom” you are sending to._\n\n**(A friendly comment)**\n\n_This is a friendly, non-gushy, opening statement._\n\n**(Get to the point)**\n\n_This explains the purpose of your correspondence._\n\n**(A friendly comment)**\n\n_This is a friendly, non-gushy, closing statement._\n\n**(Sender name)**\n\n_This is “whom” it is from._\n\n**(Sig file)**\n\n_For crying out loud, put your sig file on your emails!

Beware the Red Dot\n\n“Beware the Red Dot” is a quirky way of saying, “Make sure you reply quickly\nto email correspondence.” I have lived by this mantra for years, and I know\nthat it has had a positive impact on many business relationships.\n\n![Image](../images/00068.jpeg)\n\nThe red dot is the Mac Mail indicator that appears on the dock icon for your\nMail application. The red dot goes away when you have no unread messages. Now\nobviously, some of you are PC users and may not have a red dot reminding you\nof unread messages. But the mantra is still the same: Reply quickly to email\ncorrespondence. This accomplishes a couple key purposes:\n\n• Clients will feel like you are in the office next door as a part of their\nteam. They will get the message that you are accessible, and that you care\nabout them and their project.\n\n• Requests from people don’t stack up on top of each other that would\notherwise cause a lot of work and undue stress later.\n\nIf you are the “To” recipient of an email, you are the “owner” of the\ninformation and it is your responsibility to respond. Some requests can be\ntaken care of immediately and others may take some time. Either way, a prompt\nreply is advised. If you can take care of the request in a few minutes, do it\nand notify the client that it is complete. If the request will take some time,\nreply quickly to the client to let them know that you received the request and\nthen give them an expectation as to when it will be taken care of.\n\nNo matter what your go-to response is, the important thing is that you take\nthe time to keep your clients up to date and abreast of all project\nworkings—including any changes to previous work orders or requests for\nadditional information or progress reports.",

Before I left I made sure to\nemail my business contact the flight information, as they were arranging to\npick me up at the airport when I landed. I checked my email before getting on\nthe plane to see if they had responded that my flight itinerary was received.\nNo reply. Throughout my four-hour flight I wasted valuable time wondering and\nworrying as to whether someone would be at the airport to pick me up or not. A\nsimple “Got your itinerary, Mike” reply back would have saved me a lot of\nwasted energy. My email had been lost in an “Email Black Hole,” and part of my\ntrust in that contact got lost with it. Fortunately, when I landed my business\ncontact was at the airport waiting for me, and things worked out—however, I\ncould have been spared the worry and wonder with just a simple reply.\n\n![Image](../images/00069.jpeg)\n\nIf someone is talking to you and you don’t respond, it comes across as being\nrude. If someone emails you and you don’t respond, it is not much different.\nNearly every email you receive should be replied to (aside from spam, of\ncourse). We often neglect to reply to an email because we are short on time,\nbecause we assume that the client “knows we got it and read it,” or because we\ndon’t have anything to say...perhaps because we don’t currently have the\nanswers to their questions. Regardless of the situation, a prompt response to\nevery email is critical to building strong relationships with your clients and\ncoworkers. The response doesn’t have to be (and often shouldn’t be) a long-\nwinded discourse; simple replies are often very appropriate in email\ncorrespondence. Here are some examples.\n\n**General use...**\n\n“Got your email. Thanks!” (A simple confirmation like this can put the email\nsender at ease, knowing that you received the information they sent.)\n\n![Image](../images/00070.jpeg)\n\n**Someone emails you a question...**\n\n“Thanks for the email. I don’t have an answer to your questions just yet; I’m\nchecking with John Doe and I’ll get back to you by 4:00 P.M.” (This is a great\nway to respond quickly when you don’t have an answer to a question sent to\nyou.)\n\n**Someone emails you a simple request that merits a simple one-word\nresponse...**\n\n“Done.” (We use this in interoffice communication frequently at our company to\nlet someone know that the request they made in an email was complete. With a\nclient, though, you should probably be a little more expressive than just\nsaying “Done,” depending on your relationship level.)\n\n**Someone emails you a time-consuming request...**\n\n“Thanks for your request. I am looking into how long this will take and I’ll\nget back to you soon.” (Then go figure out the strategy and time frame needed\nto fulfill the request, and get back to the client as fast as you can.)\n\n**Someone invites you to lunch and you’re too busy...**\n\n“Thanks for the invitation. My schedule is too packed with deadlines right\nnow. Could you email me back in a couple weeks and we’ll try to schedule\nsomething in?” (If you’re really too slammed to get lunch, don’t be tacky and\nleave them hanging with no reply to their invitation; most people will\nunderstand and appreciate you extending this courtesy either way.)\n\n**Someone emails you a compliment...**\n\n“Thanks. We always appreciate feedback like that!” (You might even want to\nthrow a compliment back their way.)\n\nThese are just a few examples. Use your judgment on how to reply to emails.\nPersonally, I never file an email until I know it has been attended to either\nby myself or by someone on my team.\n\n![Image](../images/00071.jpeg)\n\n![Image](../images/00072.jpeg)",

My older brother and I would then play Lone Ranger after\nwatching an episode. He was always the Lone Ranger, and I was always Tonto.\nThinking back on that now, I wonder why the character was called the “Lone”\nRanger when his trusted sidekick, Tonto, was always around to help get him out\nof trouble. He never really did it “alone.” As much as we might think we are\n“Lone Rangers” in business environments, the reality is that we usually have\nsomeone around helping us along the way.\n\nInformation is power. When information is shared, it empowers others. There is\nvery little information in my business that is not shared with someone else.\nMy office manager has access to all the information that I do. She opens my\nmail. She balances my checkbook. She checks my voice mail. And if the\nredundancy of the information I’m responsible for doesn’t lie with her, it\nlies with one of my two vice presidents who manage all of the inflow and\noutflow of work in our business.\n\nKeeping information close to the vest is like handcuffing yourself to your\nbusiness. It makes it so you can truly never take a break, as there is always\na place where the knowledge of others stops and you are the only one who can\nstep in and bridge that gap.\n\nWe distribute information at our company in many ways. We have an internal\nblog that is accessible by everyone on our team. Our production management\ntool is online and is accessible by everyone in our company so they can see\nwhere any project stands at any given time. We have biweekly staff meetings\nwhere I probably divulge more information than our team wants to know. Though\nperhaps the best way that we ensure that every piece of information has\nredundancy is by carbon copying (Cc) someone from the team on an email. There\nare very few emails that I send that do not have at least one other person\nCc’d on them. An email to my mom is just about the only email that I’ll send\nwithout copying someone else...and even many of those have my dad copied on\nthem.\n\nCopying others on emails has been a practice at our company for years, and has\nproven to accomplish several things:\n\n• Somebody else always has the information that you have. That way if you are\nsick or detained in any way, somebody else on the team can pick up the slack.\n\n• It presents a unified front. It says to your clients that there are more\npeople supporting them than just one, thus instilling more confidence.\n\n• Many, many, many times we have been able to go into another team member’s\nemail folders and find a lost email that saved a project or solved a problem.\n\nIt is important to note that there is a delicate balance between copying\npeople onto emails for the good of all, and the alternative—seen in the\n[Section 1](part0007.html#part01) chapter “[Drama Is for Soap\nOperas](part0013.html#ch006).” Certainly it is true that when you Cc several\npeople on an email it can appear that the information is being escalated and\noverdramatized. To help avoid unnecessary drama, be sure to include only the\nappropriate people in the Cc area. For example, a designer could Cc the art\ndirector on an email to a client regarding design changes, or the sales rep\ncould Cc the company president on an email to a client with the delivery date\nof a big proposal. Whatever the content of the email may be, there is likely\nan appropriate person to Cc.\n\nOnce you begin utilizing this strategy, you will quickly realize that many\npeople in the business world have not yet learned the importance of copying\nothers on emails. Don’t get sucked into the trap of singular correspondence.\nIf a client or contact emails you valuable information, be sure to forward it\nto the most appropriate person on your team, abiding by the mantra that “Even\nthe Lone Ranger Had Tonto.”\n\n![Image](../images/00073.jpeg)\n\n\n## 51\\.

    "chunk_full": "## 51\\. Canned Communication\n\n“There is no doubt about it: Our agency churns out a ton of projects—more than\n1,500 projects in our first ten years of business, to be more specific. Each\nproject averages about eight milestones, and each milestone requires a\ndelivery email of some sort to be sent to the client. That adds up to\napproximately 12,000 structured delivery emails to our clients in about a\ndecade. If you average that over ten years, it equates to roughly 4.6 email\ndeliveries to a client per day, or an email every half an hour or so.\n\nAfter looking into this more, we quickly found that we were writing the same\nthings over and over again. The delivery email for first comps of a website\ndesign to one client didn’t change much from the email that needed to be sent\nto another client for a similar project. In order to simplify our day a bit\nand to ensure that our messaging was consistent across all team members, we\ndecided to create what we call “Canned Communication.” This is not a\nrevolutionary idea, but I suppose the fact that I didn’t have a tool like this\nuntil about ten years into my career means that most of you don’t have it\neither.\n\nThe easiest way to start using this invaluable time-saving process is to open\na blank document in your favorite word processing software, title it “Canned\nCommunication,” and start writing the best messages you can for every type of\nemail you send to your clients. These email messages will become your template\nfor all future emails.\n\nFor example, you’ll probably have canned messages for “Website First Comps\nDelivery,” “Logo First Comps Delivery,” “Final Clickable Website,” “Project\nComplete,” and so on. If you work with a group, it is a great idea to place\nthe canned messages on a server that everyone has access to.\n\nThe trick to this is that you don’t want to sound like a copy-and-paste robot\nin your emails. Even though C-3PO was a keystone figure in the _Star Wars_\nsaga, I am confident in saying that his ability to draw people in and make\nthem feel special and unique was not on the top of his special skills list. So\nyou’ll need to have certain parts of your messages that will always be\ncustomized before you send the message out. This is where it becomes even more\nimportant that you proofread your messages before sending them out into the\nWild West that is Cyberspace—there is nothing more embarrassing than having a\nclient open up an email only to find it is a template and there is nothing of\nvalue to them at all.\n\nWe have had a few employees send “Canned Communication” to a client without\nfilling out the “Name” areas. This is totally embarrassing and, again, would\nnever happen if the messages were actually read prior to clicking Send.\n\nNot everyone works in the same ways, so you’ll want to create messages that\nmatch your tone and project types. Here are several examples of our own\n“Canned Communication” to help illustrate how we utilize this system.\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00074.jpeg) **Proposal Delivery Message**\n\n_Dear [Client Name],_\n\n_I hope your day is going well!_\n\n_Attached please find our proposal for your review.

Tin Can Phones\n\nEver play with tin can phones? If you have, you know that what is said on one\nside isn’t always the same as what is received on the other. Similarly, most\neveryone has played the game Telephone, where you sit in a circle and someone\nwhispers something in the ear of the person next to him or her, and then that\nperson whispers it to the person next to them. And so it goes, until the\nmessage travels around the circle; by the time it gets back around, the\nmessage is often very different than the original meaning.\n\nWith the advances in technology, taking the time to talk to people face to\nface is a dying art. After all, why have an uncomfortable verbal communication\nwith someone when you could easily hide behind the beauty of an expertly\ncrafted email or text message? All right, I am kidding just a little about\nthis, although there is some truth to it if we were to really examine our\nsociety.\n\nAs designers, it is critically important that we have successful phone and\ninterpersonal communication with clients. At our agency, presentation skills\nare at the top of the list of attributes we look for when we interview\ncandidates for our team. As important as verbal communication is, we should\nnever rely on our clients to remember the conversation in the same way that we\ndo.\n\n![Image](../images/00076.jpeg)\n\nEvery verbal correspondence with a client where a decision is made should be\nfollowed up with a form of written correspondence for proper record keeping as\nwell as to ensure that we are on the same page as the client. Here are some\nexamples:\n\n• Account Rep Z receives a phone call from a client asking for a change to a\nproposal. After he hangs up the phone he shoots off an email message to the\ntune of, “Client X, nice chatting with you just now! Per our conversation,\nI’ll have the new proposal to you by the end of business hours tomorrow. Have\na great evening!”\n\n• Project Manager X and Designers Y and Z have a conference call with Client Y\nand four of his cronies. After the call, Project Manager X sends an email to\nthe client saying, “Client Y, we enjoyed the conference call. Thanks for your\ntime. Just wanted to shoot you our notes from the meeting for your review.\nPlease let us know if we missed anything!” (followed by the meeting notes).\n\nThis correspondence does not need to be lengthy. Just a quick one-line message\nwill often do the trick. Our clients often remark on our communication skills,\nwhich are high on the list of what our clients love about us. By following up\nverbal communication with written communication, you can cut off many\nmisunderstandings at the pass, so to speak, and you can keep clients happy\nmore consistently.\n\n* * *\n\nTAKING THE TIME TO\n\nTALK TO PEOPLE\n\nFACE TO FACE\n\nIS A DYING ART.\n\n* * *",

    "chunk_full": "## 53\\. Vicious Vernacular\n\nJust yesterday our creative director came into my office to discuss a\nchallenge he was having with a major entertainment industry client. We are\nwrapping up a ten-month long, $400,000 website design and programming project.\nOver the course of the project we have bent over backwards in an effort to\nsatisfy what has largely become an unsatisfiable client. We are on the final\npunch list and our creative director had a call with the client to review the\nstatus. During the call things got a little heated and the client began to\nrefer to the final punch items in an extreme way. Her vicious vernacular\n(intentional or not) was doing a good job of shutting down our creative\ndirector.\n\nShe referred to punch-list items as “massive bugs,” making them seem\nimpossible to overcome. My creative director considered them “minor tweaks.”\n\nFortunately for our company, during our production meeting my creative\ndirector used less vicious vernacular by referring to the punch-list items as\nminor. Minor tweaks are manageable, possible to overcome, not painful. The\nteam is heads-down and filled with positivity as they work through the final\nitems. This is the eleventh hour. The project has to get done and emotions are\nalready high. I can only imagine the repercussions inside our production\nenvironment if he would have instead passed along the extreme massive bug\nphrasing. Would we have had a revolt? Would people have been disgruntled?\nDemoralized? Even quit?\n\nSince graphic design is sometimes like open heart surgery, we need to be\ncareful how we phrase things. Imagine a stressed out and worried family in the\nwaiting room. Their loved one has been in surgery for hours on end with no end\nin sight. They wait and wait and then finally the heart surgeon comes out to\ngive them an update...\n\n“Well, John is doing _OK_. We’re having to rush to _fix_ _a lot_ of things.”\n\nThis Vicious Vernacular does nothing to help put the family at ease.\n\n_OK_ implies that things aren’t great.\n\n_Rush_ implies that there is an emergency.\n\n_Fix_ implies that things are broken.\n\n_A lot_ implies that many things are wrong.\n\nA few subtle changes in phrasing can do wonders in helping the family feel\nmore at ease, such as:\n\n“Well, John is doing _fine_. We’re having to _be proactive_ to _adjust_ some\nthings.”\n\n_Fine_ implies that things are stable.\n\n_Be proactive_ implies that the doctors are working quickly, but there is no\nemergency.\n\n_Adjust_ implies that there are subtle modifications to be made.\n\n_Some_ implies that not everything is wrong.\n\nHere are some typical words to avoid, as well as some excellent substitutes:\n\n• Instead of _fix_ , use _tweak_ or _adjust_.\n\n• Instead of _changes_ , use _requests_ , _adjustments_ , _revisions_ , or\n_modifications_.\n\n• Instead of _rush_ , use _work quickly_ or _be productive_.\n\n• Instead of _issues_ , use _elements_.\n\n• Instead of _problems_ , use _items_.\n\n• Instead of _improve_ , use _modify_.\n\n• Instead of _tight timeline_ , use _aggressive schedule_.\n\n**Instead of telling your client...**\n\n“We are making your _changes_.”\n\n**Tell them...**\n\n“We are accommodating (or updating) your _requests_.”\n\n**Instead of telling your client...**\n\n“We are _rushing_ to hit the deadline.”\n\n**Tell them...**\n\n“We are _being productive_ to hit the deadline.”\n\n**Instead of telling your client...**\n\n“We are working on some _issues_ that are taking extra time.”\n\n**Tell them...**\n\n“We are working on some _elements_ that are taking _a little bit_ of extra\ntime.”\n\n**Instead of telling your client...**\n\n“The team is working to _fix_ all the _problems_ in preparation for delivery.”\n\n**Tell them...**\n\n“The team is working to adjust all the _items_ in preparation for delivery.”\n\nYou get the idea. Be careful when writing and speaking to use nonescalating\nwords and phrases that will keep your client’s stress level as low as\npossible.",

But even when I worked as an\nindependent freelancer, it took more than just me to satisfy my clients. I had\nan accountant. I sometimes vended out overflow work out to my graphic designer\nfriends. My wife spent countless hours talking me off the ledge. “Me,” even\nwhen I was technically flying solo, was really “Us.”\n\nEven then, I always made an effort to phrase things in a way that conveyed the\nmessage of multiple people supporting the client. I replaced words like “me”\nand “I” with “we” and “us.” I didn’t want my client’s confidence shaken by\nthinking that they had the support of only some guy in his basement. I wanted\nthem to feel like they had an army of support. An army can win the wars that\none guy with a BB gun can only dream of fighting.\n\nAs my company grew, the “we” and “us” team-style phrasing rang more and more\ntrue; we really did have an army helping our clients and we took every\nopportunity to remind them of that important fact. Our team is instructed to\nmake sure they convey that team attitude in all their client correspondence.\nAs a result, our clients take comfort in knowing that their project is being\nworked on and reviewed by many people, which makes them feel like they are\ngetting a lot of value for their money. They worry less about deadlines and\nquality knowing that multiple people are watching out for them and for the\nquality of their project.\n\n**Replace...**\n\n“ _I_ received your feedback.”\n\n**with...**\n\n“ _We_ received your feedback.”\n\n**Replace...**\n\n“I’m _the_ designer working on your comps.”\n\n**with...**\n\n“I’m _one_ of the designers working on your comps.”\n\n**Replace...**\n\n“ _I_ should be able to finish the design changes by the end of the day.”\n\n**with...**\n\n“I’m working with _the design team_ to finish the changes by the end of the\nday.”\n\n**Say things like...**\n\n“ _We’re_ getting close to wrapping up the project.”\n\n“ _Everyone_ has enjoyed working on this project.”\n\n“ _We_ conducted an internal review of the comps.”\n\n“Thank you for sending those assets to _us_. _We_ are starting work on your\ncomps immediately.”\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nIf you really are working by yourself, I’m not encouraging you to lie. I’m\nmerely stating that you have to recognize that there is almost always someone\nelse in your army even when you are an independent freelancer. Talking this\nway helps the client understand that as well. When the client understands that\nan army is backing them, they sleep a little easier at night. And in the end,\nthat’s all the client really wants from you...the confidence that you are\ngoing to execute every small detail of their project successfully and\nfabulously.\n\n![Image](../images/00077.jpeg)\n\nAs for actual team environment, this sentiment is imperative to cohesiveness\nand unity. It is easy for art directors to take credit for the work of others,\nwhich inevitably causes frustration and resentment to grow within their team.\nNapoleon Hill, in his masterpiece _Think and Grow Rich_ , cited this behavior\nas being one of the ten major causes of failure in leadership.\n\n_“The leader who claims all the honor for the work of his followers is sure to\nbe met by resentment. The really great leader CLAIMS NONE OF THE HONORS. He is\ncontented to see the honors, when there are any, go to his followers, because\nhe knows that most men will work harder for commendation and recognition than\nthey will for money alone.”_\n\n—Think and Grow Rich, _1937, 82_\n\nWe might all be better off to just remove the words “I,” “my,” and “mine” from\nour vocabularies. Clients will feel more secure knowing there are many people\nsupporting them, and the other members of your team will appreciate and\nrespect your humble approach.",

    "chunk_full": "## 55\\. Friendly Updates\n\nDoctors seem to understand something that many graphic designers don’t: the\nneed for “friendly updates.”\n\nImagine, if you will, a beautiful happy family: a dad, a mom, and a few kids.\nThis unfortunate family learns that dad has a heart problem and needs to have\na major surgery. The whole family heads to the hospital together on the day of\nthe surgery. They meet together with the doctor who reassures them that his\nteam knows what they are doing; they have done this surgery thousands of\ntimes. The family sighs in relief, feeling like everything is going to be\n“OK.” Dad is wheeled off into the operating room and the rest of the family\ngathers closely together in the waiting room. The clock watching begins.\n\nEvery hour, on the hour, the doctor sends a nurse from the operating room to\nthe waiting room. “Your husband is doing great. The surgery is progressing as\nplanned, no complications whatsoever,” the nurse reassures the family. These\nfriendly updates keep the family from panicking and they continue to wait\nanxiously, but confidently, throughout the lengthy surgery.\n\nNow imagine the same scenario without the regularly sent, reassuring messages\nfrom the doctor.\n\nDuring the first hour, mom keeps thinking about the doctor’s confidence. She\nbelieves everything is going to be fine.\n\nDuring the second hour, she remains confident, but her memory of the doctor’s\nconfidence begins to fade. Butterflies start to flutter in her tummy.\n\nDuring the third hour, mom starts looking up every time a nurse walks in. She\nis in need of some reassurance.\n\nDuring the fourth hour, mom can’t remember anything the doctor said. Panic\nsets in. She starts imagining her husband flat lining on the operating table.\n\nDuring the fifth hour, mom is in a total state of hysteria. She is sure her\nhusband is dead. Her hysteria spreads to her kids. Everyone is freaking out.\n\n![Image](../images/00078.jpeg)\n\n“Friendly updates” could have changed everything for the family above.\n\nI often say that graphic design is like open heart surgery. The area of\nfriendly updates is one of those cases. Many clients freak out about their\nprojects like the family did about the dad’s surgery in the above example. The\nless you communicate, the more your clients will begin to get nervous, panic,\nor even freak out.\n\nIt is critical to keep your finger on the pulse of your projects and provide\n“friendly updates” to your clients to reassure them that everything is going\nto be OK. This is especially true if the milestones are spread out over long\nperiods of time.\n\nQuick, short, email updates can make all the difference in the success or\nfailure of a project—especially where new clients are concerned. Tell your\nclients what you are working on and reassure them that you have their project\non your mind and in your project queue. A great example of a friendly status\nupdate could be as simple as this:\n\n“Just wanted to shoot you a quick email to let you know that we started\ndesigning your logos today. We have some great ideas and look forward to\nsending them on Tuesday.”\n\nAlternatively, you could begin with something like this:\n\n“The team began programming your site today...”\n\n“We provisioned your server this afternoon...”\n\n“We’ve made good progress on your comps and plan to send them to you tomorrow\nafternoon per the schedule...”\n\nThese are just a few examples. Each of these updates will help your clients\nget back to the level of confidence they had in you at hour one. Use your\njudgment and try not to overwhelm them with details when you send them a\nfriendly update. Just reassure them that you are in control of their project\nand that it isn’t flat lining on the table.\n\n* * *\n\nJUST REASSURE THEM THAT\n\nYOU ARE IN CONTROL\n\nOF THEIR PROJECT\n\nAND THAT IT ISN’T FLAT\n\nLINING ON THE TABLE.\n\n* * *",

    "chunk_full": "## 56\\. Deadline Ballet\n\nOne of the fastest ways to ruin a client relationship is to miss a deadline.\nYou must make every effort possible to deliver on what you commit to your\nclients, bosses, and coworkers. At times there are reasonable circumstances\nthat create an inability to deliver on a promise. While these circumstances\nneed to be kept to a minimum, when they do happen there are strategies to help\nyou gracefully dance through an uncomfortable situation.\n\n**Get others involved.** As soon as you feel a deadline may be in jeopardy,\nyou should run it up the chain of command. If you are a designer, tell your\nart director or business owner. You have to make people aware as soon as you\nknow a deadline will be missed. The later you notify the appropriate people,\nthe bigger their disappointment will likely be. Nobody likes this type of\nsurprise.\n\n**Be deliberate about communication.** An increase in the scope of a project\nis often the biggest culprit behind a missed deadline. You’ll be on a call\nwith a client and they will ask for something new; this is the moment to talk\nabout the deadline, not a few days later when the deadline is zooming by you\nat the speed of light.\n\nIt is not uncommon for a client to miss a deadline on their end. They may be\nlate in sending you necessary assets for the project. As soon as they miss\ntheir milestone for delivery of assets, you must begin a discussion with your\nclient and your creative director or boss about the deadline in question.\n\nAnother reason for missed deadlines is an unanticipated software glitch, or\nmaybe your computer gives out on you. Perhaps you are programming something\nfor a website and there is a bug in the code. These types of problems happen\nand can cause extreme delays in production. When things like this go down, it\nis vital that you communicate the problem and take an active role in finding a\nsolution. Be warned, however, that clients aren’t too interested in “the dog\nate my homework” stories. Be sure you have version controls on code and backup\nversions of files to hedge against the chance of software and computer issues.\n\n**Put your tail between your legs and fess up.** When a deadline is in\njeopardy, a message should be sent to the client. The message should be\napologetic in tone and should state the reasons for missing the deadline. Even\nif there is a death in the family, you should muster the strength to apologize\nfor the missed deadline.\n\nIf the client is the cause of a missed deadline, be careful not to play the\n“blame game.” State the facts and apologize. If you are at a point in the\nproject where you have something that is appropriate to send as is, then send\nit so the client can at least see where the project stands.\n\n**Realign expectations.** Now that the cat is out of the bag, you need to\nestablish a new set of expectations with the client. Make sure that you and\nthe client both understand the new milestones and be sure to put it in\nwriting. If it is a verbal conversation, make sure to send a follow-up email\nas well.\n\n![Image](../images/00079.jpeg)\n\n**Hit the next deadline and apologize again.** One missed deadline, and you\nmight be able to salvage the client relationship. Two missed deadlines and you\nare probably doomed. Be sure you hit the realigned milestones, and when you\ndo, be sure to apologize again for missing the previous deadline.\n\n**Rebuild the relationship.** Once you successfully complete the project,\nbegin your efforts to rebuild trust with the client. Don’t be afraid to talk\nabout the missed deadline. Discuss with them what you have changed in you\nprocess to ensure it won’t happen again. Tell them how important they are to\nyou and your business. Now is a good time for a lunch invite or another “out\nof the office” experience to help strengthen the relationship.\n\nMissed deadlines will happen. Most of your clients know that and have\nexperienced it. If you take the right tone with the client, your relationship\ncan survive the setback and more projects will likely come your way.",

    "chunk_full": "## 57\\. Big Brother\n\nAbout a year into my career, fresh out of school, I was on a conference call\nwith a client. From my direct marketing agency, it was two team members and me\nspeaking with the client. We were building a website and creating various\nother marketing materials for them, and they were having difficulty grasping\nour explanation of the project. We became increasingly frustrated due to their\nignorance, and when the call ended we hung up the phone and began a rant about\nthis client’s apparent idiocy. Then I glanced down at the phone and realized\nthat the light was indicating the line was still active. I broke out into a\ncold sweat and quickly tapped the disconnect button about a dozen times.\n\n![Image](../images/00080.jpeg)\n\nHad they heard all the names we just called them? To this day I still don’t\nknow. And it doesn’t matter anyway; there is no doubt that I learned my\nlesson: “You have to assume that someone is always listening.” Think about it\nfor a minute. There are so many ways that someone can overhear you trash-\ntalking your clients, your colleagues, or any number of other seemingly\nunsuspecting people in your life.\n\nIs the phone line really disconnected?\n\nAre you sure that someone isn’t in the other room? Down the hall? Up the\nstairs?\n\nDoes the mute button really work on your phone?\n\nIs your teammate on a call with a client who can hear you in the background?\n\nAre the walls really as soundproof as you think?\n\nPerhaps you assume you’ll be safe speaking outside or ranting over lunch with\nyour coworkers. Are you sure the people sitting within earshot don’t know who\nyou are or who it is you are talking negatively about? You can’t be certain.\n\nYou have to be especially careful of this issue online. Your personal Twitter\nand Facebook posts can spell relationship disaster if used to vent about a\nfrustrating client or project. Once that information gets blasted into the\nblack hole of cyberspace, you can never take it back.\n\nI have an acquaintance that seems addicted to complaining about people. Every\ntime I’m with this person, it seems they have a new person to bash on. I\nreluctantly listen and think to myself, “Hmmm. I wonder what they say about me\nwhen I’m not around.” If you complain to one client about another client, they\ncould easily assume that you do the same thing about them. This type of\nbehavior quickly erodes hard-earned trust and can tarnish your reputation as a\ndesigner as well as a person of character and integrity.\n\nOK, let’s be honest. A little venting can be a healthy way to cleanse yourself\nof life’s frustrations. And, admittedly, some clients certainly deserve every\nounce of negativity you may telepathically (or even verbally) be sending their\ndirection. But you had better be absolutely certain that your remarks are\nconfidential, or they can destroy a profitable relationship for you or the\nbusiness you work in.\n\nMaybe the best thing to do is take the old advice, “If you can’t say anything\nnice, don’t say anything at all,” and apply it to your life at home, at work,\nand with your friends. The conspiracy theorists might be right: Big Brother\njust may be listening after all.\n\n![Image](../images/00081.jpeg)\n\n\n## 58\\. The Domino Effect\n\nMy childhood fight against boredom drove me to find creative outlets. In\nbetween fort building and forest exploration, my brothers and I spent hours\nand hours playing with Legos, Lincoln Logs, Erector Sets, and dominos. I have\nfond memories of setting up domino trails and knocking them down. One tap on\nthe first domino sets off a chain reaction that cannot be stopped until it\ntopples every other domino in the trail.\n\nFew things say to your client “we’ve got your back” better than creating a\nchain reaction. Here is an example of a chain reaction in our business:\n\n**1.** Client X calls or emails to green light a project.\n\n**2.** Immediately: Business development person sends an email to the client,\n“Thanks for sending this project to our team. Everyone is excited to work on\nit. I’ve Cc’d our production manager, John Doe, to loop him in on the project\nso that he can get things rolling with his team. I’d also like to introduce\nyou to Jane Doe who handles our accounting. She will be in touch regarding\ninvoicing details.”\n\n**3.",

I\nwill be the point person for all accounting procedures. Is there a Purchase\nOrder number that we should include on our invoices? Also, are you the best\ncontact for invoicing or should we get in touch with someone else for those\ndetails?”\n\n**5.** Within one hour: Production manager sets up the project in the online\nproduction software and Client X receives an email with instructions regarding\nhow to access that information. Production manager also sets up FTP access for\nthe client to upload assets to the server.\n\n**6.** Within 24 hours: Production manager sends an email to Client X\nintroducing them to the art director on the project. The art director then\nrequests to set up a Kickoff Meeting with the client to discuss the design\ndetails of the project and ensure that the design team and the client are on\nthe same page.\n\nImagine how Client X will feel as this sequence of events plays out. Within\nthe first 24 hours after giving the project the green light, they have been in\ncorrespondence with four key people on the team, accessed your production\nmanagement software, gained FTP access to your servers, and scheduled a\nKickoff Meeting with the art director and design team. All of these things\nwere instigated based on a chain reaction that began with Client X green\nlighting a project. The only reaction the client can possibly have is, “Wow,\nthese people are on top of this project!”\n\nEvery business is unique. Perhaps your business does not have an art director\nor office manager. Whether your company is large or small, or if you are just\na one-person team working out of a dimly lit corner of your basement—it makes\nno difference; chain reaction systems can be created for any size or type of\nbusiness. Getting started is easy; simply pull out a piece of paper and start\njotting down the sequence of events that follow key moments in your projects.\n\nIt may look something like this:\n\n**Event: Client green lights a proposal.**\n\nChain reaction: What happens next?\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n**Event: Client sends feedback on design comps.**\n\nChain reaction: What happens next?\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\n**Event: Project is completed and approved by the client.**\n\nChain reaction: What happens next?\n\n•\n\n•\n\n•\n\nEach of the events in your chain reactions list should be designed to amaze\nyour client with your organizational skills and attention to the details of\nthe project. Formalize and document your chain reactions so that they can be\nutilized by all the members of your team, thus ensuring a unified client\nexperience with your company.\n\nIn contrast to all of this, few things scream, “we don’t really care about\nyour project!” more than a client green lighting a project and then having\nseveral days pass before any communication or progress is made on your end.\nEven if the project isn’t scheduled to start for a couple weeks, it is still\nimportant to keep regular communication going in the down time.",

No, we’re not talking about the World Wide Web—we are\ntalking about the fact that you never want your clients to Wait, Worry, or\nWonder (the W.W.W.). Every effort should be made to avoid these concepts in\nyour dealings with your customers and clients.\n\n![Image](../images/00083.jpeg)\n\n**Wait.** Clients should never be left “waiting” on you. If you say that you\nwill send them comps at 3:00 P.M., then make sure you send them at 3:00 P.M.\nIf you are not going to make that deadline, then by no later than 3:00 P.M.\nyou must reach out to them via email or phone, letting them know that you are\nrunning a little behind and you won’t have the comps ready until 4:00 P.M. (or\nby whatever new time you anticipate having things wrapped up.)\n\nIf you have a client meeting scheduled for 10:00 A.M., then you should show up\nat 9:55 A.M. If you’re not there as 10:05 A.M. rolls around, the client’s\nconfidence in you begins to take a nosedive.\n\n**Worry.** Clients should never “worry” about the responsibilities they have\ngiven you. Part of your responsibility is to exude confidence in your ability\nto execute on their project. By clearly communicating expectations and your\ndevelopment strategies, you can keep your clients from “worrying”\nunnecessarily.\n\n**Wonder.** “I wonder if anyone is working on my project?” “I wonder what I’m\ngoing to see next?” “I wonder if these guys understand what I’m trying to\naccomplish with my project?” These and more are the types of things your\nclients should not be “wondering” about you.\n\nClear communication is the key to avoiding the W.W.W. This includes clearly\ncommunicating timelines, development strategies, contact information,\nconceptual understanding of the project, and any other pertinent information\nrelated to succeeding on the project your client has entrusted you with.\n\n* * *\n\nCLEAR COMMUNICATION\n\nIS THE KEY.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 60\\.

Perhaps\nall those years of sending unintentional typos to my clients have scarred me\ninto a state of perpetual paranoia.

What would improve it?\n\n• Compare the design to other projects the client may have mentioned or that\nyou used as inspiration (such as example sites or printed material). Does the\ndesign meet or exceed the quality level of those samples?\n\n• What is the point of the design? Is it trying to sell something? Tell a\nstory? Convey a message? Is this accomplished from a big-picture standpoint?\n\n• Are the dimensions of the design appropriate for the project?\n\n• Is any text the same from area to area within the project, and if so is it\nconsistent in all ways?\n\n**Broad Strokes (Begin drilling into the main areas in the project.)**\n\n• How does the eye flow through the design? Is the eye resting and focusing on\nthe right elements in the right order?\n\n• Does the visual weight of the design elements work? Is there anything that’s\ntoo heavy? Too light?\n\n• Is the color palette working? Are there colors that do not seem to fit the\nbrand or design?\n\n• How are the font choices? Are there too many being used? Too few? Do they\nwork well in the design?\n\n• Do photos and images match and support the overall design and messaging?\n\n• Is the core messaging clear? Is there a headline or other text that needs to\nconvey a different message? Will people easily know what they are looking at?\n\n**Nitty Gritty (Scan through every pixel of the project in detail.)**\n\n• Look at every single word and punctuation. Are there typos?\n\n• Are design elements structured on the grid properly? Is there anything that\ncould break the plane on the grid to add more interest to the design?\n\n• Is there anything off-center or out of alignment? Text elements are the\nbiggest culprits of this problem.\n\n• Have photos been treated properly? Have they been adjusted and enhanced\nproperly? Are photos facing the right direction? Have they been cropped\nproperly?\n\n• Is font usage consistent in the design? Is the text spaced properly (leading\nand kerning)? Is there any missing punctuation? Any widows or orphans?

The Tragedy of Time Zones\n\nIn the early years of my business, most of our clients were in Los Angeles\n(Pacific Standard Time). My company was located in Utah (Mountain Standard\nTime), which carried a one-hour time difference with the bulk of our clients.\nAt the time, most of our team worked a 9:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M. shift. This\nmeant that our day was ending around 5:00 P.M. in Los Angeles.\n\nMany days included a scramble to meet our deadlines. I remember numerous days\nwhere we would click Send on a delivery email at 6:01 P.M. to hit our\ndeadline. The time difference between our location and that of our clients was\ndefinitely working in our favor, as 6:01 P.M. was 5:01 P.M. in Hollywood.\n\n![Image](../images/00085.jpeg)\n\nAlthough this strategy was seemingly working, oftentimes our clients would\nblast back a response for us to make a few minor edits before they could send\nthe designs up the chain of command for approvals. This response often led to\nus needing to stay later than expected to implement the client’s changes.\n\nOur solution to this problem was to move our delivery time back a couple\nhours. Instead of considering 6:00 P.M. an acceptable delivery hour, we pushed\nit back to 4:00 P.M. This meant we could hit our deadline and still have a\ncouple of hours left in our day to make last-minute client changes.\n\nThe success of this strategy was short-lived, as soon thereafter we began to\nsecure clients on the east coast—mainly in New York City and Washington D.C.\nThese clients had a two-hour time change that was working against us. Our 4:00\nP.M. deadline delivery goal became 6:00 P.M. in these clients’ locations. If\nthese clients requested some last-second adjustments to their designs, they\nwere often left staying late at their office as they waited on us to make the\nchanges. (Making your client stay late at work is not a good way to make them\nlove you.)\n\n![Image](../images/00086.jpeg)\n\nAll of this came to a head when we were creating a large interactive website\nfor a major consumer products company. The project had gone famously. The\nclient was ecstatic with our work and with their interaction with our team. We\nalmost got through the project without a single blemish until the day of the\nsoft launch of the project when we received this email from our client:\n\n“We never got a link today for final review of the development site. We’re\ngoing to push the launch of the site until tomorrow.”\n\nIt was only 3:30 P.M. our time when this correspondence came through. But with\nthe time change, it was 5:30 P.M. in our client’s location. Even though we\nstill had a couple hours left in our day, in their eyes, the business day was\nover and we missed the deadline.\n\nI felt awful. Our perfect relationship had now been marred by a slipped\ndeadline. I envisioned the client checking their email periodically throughout\nthe day and their disappointment growing with every email check that didn’t\nyield our delivery. Did they badmouth us to a coworker?",

Did they badmouth us to a coworker? Was their boss’ boss\nwondering where the delivery was? Would we be able to salvage the\nrelationship?\n\nFortunately for us, we had built up enough clout with the client to see us\nthrough this incident, but a valuable lesson was learned. Graphic design is a\ndeadline-driven industry. Designers, for the most part, are all used to\nworking under the gun of the deadline. However, that deadline is often\nmistakenly just a “date” and not an “hour.”\n\n![Image](../images/00087.jpeg)\n\nTo remedy our problems with time zones and worrisome clients, we strive to\nsend our day’s deliveries in the morning. Unless you are working\ninternationally, your clients will typically receive your morning delivery\nwith applause. For us, a morning delivery typically ensures that our West\nCoast clients receive their deadline deliverables before they get into the\noffice, and our East Coast clients receive them around lunchtime.\n\nEven if you are doing work in only one time zone, meeting your deadlines\nbefore lunch is a better way of doing business. By doing so, your clients will\nhave a window several hours long that ensures they will know that the deadline\nwas hit. And you will be able to relax all day knowing that the pressure is\noff for the time being.\n\n![Image](../images/00088.jpeg)\n\nMost of us learned the art of procrastination while working our way through\ngrade school. This art is often perfected in the first few years working as a\nprofessional graphic designer. The best way to ensure that deliveries can\nhappen in the morning is to put pressure on yourself to have everything ready\nthe night before.\n\n![Image](../images/00089.jpeg)\n\n\n# Section 4: Happy Head Honchos\n\nEVERYONE HAS TO ANSWER TO SOMEONE.

Designers Are from Mars, Clients Are from Venus\n\nJust about a year after my wife and I were married, we were invited to attend\nan evening dinner event where a professional marriage counselor planned to\ntalk about how to make a great marriage. Although our marriage was (and is) a\ngreat one, we decided to attend the “break from the norm” date night. The\ncounselor gave a great speech—funny and well presented. Like a typical male, I\ndon’t recall everything he said...merely a few highlights.\n\nHe explained to the young crowd that men and women differ in many ways. For\nexample, when presented with life’s trials, women seek to be understood and\ncomforted, whereas men seek solutions. As a result, when helping someone (like\na spouse) through life’s trials, women give comfort and understanding, and men\ngive solutions. He continued to illustrate the point that men think one way\nand women think another.\n\n![Image](../images/00090.jpeg)\n\nIronically, his time ran out and he didn’t get to the portion of his speech\nwhere he presented to the group “the solution” to the dilemma. My beloved new\nbride and I went home and she cried for an hour as she wondered how we were\never going to make our marriage work while being so naturally incompatible.

Of\ncourse, I presented her with plenty of solutions.\n\nGraphic designer and client relationships are often like husband and wife.\nSometimes love is in the air. Sometimes frustrations arise. And sometimes\ndivorce is inevitable. Most of these divorces are the result of the fact that\ndesigners think and act one way and clients think and act another.\n\nThis chapter may come across like that marriage counselor’s speech. I intend\non illustrating the differences in how designers and clients think, but not\nprovide you with any solutions. In some ways this book itself is an effort to\nbe a solution to this dilemma. But the harsh reality may be that there is no\ncut-and-dried solution. However, the simple knowledge of the differences could\nbe enough to help avoid the potential pitfalls found in the natural\nincompatibilities between designers and clients.\n\nLet’s start with what makes designers tick. You likely became a designer\nbecause the insatiable need to create things fuels your soul.\n\n**You want to design cool stuff.** That is item number one and needs no\nexplanation.\n\n**You likely want to make money while you design cool stuff.** Otherwise, you\nprobably would have chosen a different form of art.\n\nPretty simple: Designers want to design cool things and make money. As a\nresult, designers spend all kinds of time trying to sell people on the fact\nthat they can create cool things. They design slick portfolio sites. They\ncreate books showing off their work. Heck, at my company we even put portfolio\nsamples on the back of our business cards as we search for every opportunity\nto show off the cool stuff we can create. We do all this in an attempt to make\nmoney doing what we love.\n\nSo what do clients want? In my experience, clients are in search of the\nfollowing types of things.\n\n**A return on their investment.** They expect to spend money to make money.\nClients typically expect that buying graphic design services from you will\nyield more sales and money for them.\n\n**Looking good for their boss.** Many of the people you work for have a boss\nor other stakeholder breathing down their neck. Their goal in hiring you is to\nhelp them look good.\n\n**Stress relief.** Clients are often stressed, worried, or confused about\ntheir graphic design project needs. They are looking to you to lighten their\nload. They just want to be able to sleep at night. They want to trust and have\nconfidence in your ability to execute on their project.\n\n**A good deal.** Clients are shopping for a good deal. They want you to work\nfor as cheap as possible. No, not every client plans to financially abuse you,\nbut plenty of them do.\n\n**Relationships.** Most clients are searching for someone who can solve these\nproblems for them on a regular basis. They want to build a relationship with\ntheir vendor so they don’t have to go through the trauma of searching for a\nvendor all over again.\n\n**Good design.** In some rare circumstances, clients may be actually searching\nfor amazing design. But in most cases, clients care about good design only as\na means to accomplishing the other objectives previously noted.\n\nDesigners try hard to sell graphic design. What they really should be selling\nare the things the client, boss, or stakeholder really wants. People buy\nconfidence. People buy trust. People buy relationships. People buy stress\nrelief. People buy good deals.

Let Your Client Leave Their Mark\n\nMost of your clients want to feel like they have in some way influenced the\nwork you are creating for them. Not only is it wise to let them think that,\nbut it’s good practice to sometimes graciously accept their influence.\nHowever, many designers tend to be naturally defensive about their work.\nDuring client presentations, these types of designers go in with their armor\non and shields up, ready to defend their design to the death if need be.\nWhether a client’s feedback is big or small, a battle will ensue where the\ndesigner will argue every point the client makes in order to keep their\nprecious design intact. This attitude causes problems in several areas.\n\nFirst, this approach to design defense does not recognize that the client is\npaying for the work. If they want you to try something in red instead of blue,\nthey are entitled to see that comp. They’re writing the check. Giving in to\nclient requests does not show weakness, but rather it shows that you respect\nthe client and understand your relationship—they are paying you to work for\nthem.\n\nSecond, battling every little design point that a client makes does nothing\nbut create conflict and convey a sense of pride and arrogance on your part.\nYour job as a designer is to make your client’s life easier, not more\ndifficult. If they feel like they need to argue with you over every little\ndetail, their tolerance for working with you will quickly wear thin. This is a\nsurefire way to lose a client.\n\nThird, letting the client make changes to the designs helps them feel\nownership and pride in the finished product. There is no better way to help a\nclient fall in love with the design than if they perceive something to be\ntheir idea and their masterpiece. When they love the work, they will parade\nthe design around their office telling all their colleagues something like,\n“See that? That was my idea. Isn’t it cool?!” Also, when the client loves a\ndesign, they inevitably love the person who produced the design. This is the\nway to win the loyalty of long-term clients.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that I’m not suggesting that you roll over\nand agree with every comment a client makes about your work. There are times\nwhen requested changes need to be tactfully fought. I’m merely suggesting that\nletting the client leave their mark on the design can empower them to take\nownership of the project and continue coming back to you for more.\n\nThe next time a client wants to change something that seems insignificant to\nyou, don’t get riled up. It is important for your clients to leave their mark\non the work in order to feel a sense of pride in the project. Don’t try to\ntalk them out of every idea they have; instead find ways to let them leave\ntheir mark while maintaining the integrity and splendor of the design.",

    "chunk_full": "## 64\\. “Forgiveness” Points\n\nWith every new job, new boss, new client, or new project, you have one goal\nand one goal only: to build up “forgiveness points.” The graphic design\nindustry is filled with craziness. A myriad of variables will inevitably cause\na project to blow up at some point in your career. A typo may get printed.\nPerhaps a server will get hacked and disable a website you created. Maybe you\nor someone on your team will miss an important deadline. At some point in the\nlifecycle of your business relationship with a client or company, something\nwill go awry and the project will come to a screaming halt. Whether your\nrelationship with the client or employer will survive the blow depends on how\nmany forgiveness points you’ve accumulated.\n\n![Image](../images/00091.jpeg)\n\nForgiveness points are what I consider the measure of how much a client will\noverlook your flaw when it inevitably rears its ugly head. When you start a\nnew job or land a new client, you start with zero forgiveness points. Over\ntime, these points are then built up through your perfect execution of work,\nsuch as\n\n• Producing high-quality design work\n\n• Hitting deadlines\n\n• Exceeding expectations and going the extra mile\n\n• Making no mistakes in the work\n\n• Not missing client-requested changes\n\n• Building a strong relationship with the client through extracurricular\nactivities\n\nNow, knowing that you start with zero forgiveness points, if you miss the very\nfirst deadline on the very first project with a new client, the client may\nhave a tendency to say, “Wow, they missed the first deadline. This isn’t going\nwell. We need to look for someone else.” However, if you have forgiveness\npoints built up after having hit every deadline with that client over the past\ntwelve projects and then you miss a deadline, the client may be more apt to\nthink, “Wow, that stinks. But they have been so good for so long. They’ve\nnever missed a deadline before. No doubt this was a fluke and they will be\nback on top of their game in no time.”\n\nForgiveness points are quickly lost when anything goes haywire at any time in\na project, whether it is your fault or not. Examples of things that can\nwhittle away at your points are\n\n• A website server going down\n\n• An associated vendor making a mistake (a bad print job, for example)\n\n• A needless mistake (typo, forgotten request, etc.)\n\n• An argument with a client\n\n• A missed deadline\n\nWith most clients, you lose forgiveness points at a much higher rate than you\ngain them. You may have to do three great things to gain enough points to\noffset the loss of points from one bad thing. Three great projects with a\nclient might see you through one disaster project. And then you’re back at\nzero, and your client is likely thinking, “We’ll see how the next project goes\nbefore hiring them again.”\n\nAs an owner of a design agency, I have seen forgiveness points used in a\ndifferent light: as they save and lose the individual jobs of my employees. In\n2008, a programmer who had saved the day many times at our company during his\ntwo years of employment played a key role in a botched project. I never once\nconsidered letting him go. He had been “so good for so long.” He had plenty of\nforgiveness points build up to warrant my immediate and irrevocable\nforgiveness for his mistake. Alternately, in 2010, a new designer at our\ncompany had two errors go to press in his first month working at our company.\nWe had to pay for reprints on both of the jobs. This designer hadn’t proven\nhimself yet. He had zero forgiveness points in his arsenal, and thus we made\nthe decision to part ways. We couldn’t afford to keep working with him in\nhopes that he wouldn’t continue to make mistakes.\n\n![Image](../images/00092.jpeg)\n\nForgiveness points with new clients or employers take time to accrue. Stay\nfocused and on top of your game at the start of every new relationship. Over-\ndeliver and amaze your client or employer with perfect work for as long as you\ncan sustain it, because inevitably, someday, you will be at the center of a\ndisaster project with nothing to see you through but your forgiveness points.",

While this can be a difficult thing—especially if you\nare a designer with on-fire ideas and a killer portfolio—it is vital to your\ncontinued survival within the tight-knit group that is called the “client\npool.”\n\nABC Television has been a client of ours for years. We love working on their\nprojects, and our contacts there are truly fun and wonderful people. On one of\nour many visits with them we had a chat about the different personality\n“styles” that design agencies have. We talked with them about how we are\nservice oriented and always made an effort to accommodate the needs of our\nclients, no matter what.\n\n![Image](../images/00093.jpeg)\n\nOur contact at ABC began sharing some frustrations he had with an agency that\nthey had hired recently for a big project. He told us about how they had a\nmeeting to discuss the project and the agency people ended up doing a lion’s\nshare of the talking, even though ABC had definite ideas in mind of what they\nwere looking to accomplish. The agency execs told ABC what they needed and\nwhat the project should be without taking the time to listen first. I\nenvisioned the stereotypical agency troupe, walking in wearing black\nturtleneck sweaters and horn-rimmed glasses, their pointy noses in the air and\nsmartphones gleaming under the fluorescent lights. I also saw in my mind’s eye\nthese agency folks walking out of the meeting thinking they were so cool\nand—after they were gone—the ABC folks talking about “what a cocky bunch of\njerks they really were.”\n\n![Image](../images/00094.jpeg)\n\nThe lesson that I ultimately took away from this conversation was the\nimportance of “letting your client be the 800-pound gorilla.” Now, I’m not\nsaying you shouldn’t offer up recommendations and ideas. You definitely should\nhave an air of confidence and ambition when you present yourself, your\ncompany, and your ideas to a client. However, I am saying you should do it\nwith some humility and respect. Your clients are the people who butter your\nbread. In a band of silverback gorillas, they are the dominant male, the head\nhoncho that directs the day-to-day activities of the group. So be grateful for\nyour clients and, for goodness sake, take the time to listen to their ideas\nbefore offering up your own. You have two ears and one mouth for a reason: so\nthat you talk half as much as you listen. Take notes in the meeting to show\ngenuine interest in what they are saying. When you speak, do it without the\nelitist, arrogant, or demeaning front that designers can be known for (even\nthough your ideas may very well be better than their ideas). After all, the\ncompany they are hiring you to design for is their pride and joy; it’s their\nbaby. Do yourself a favor and hear them out—you will be glad that you did.\n\n![Image](../images/00095.jpeg)",

Do Your Genealogy\n\nPrevious chapters have gone a long way toward establishing the importance of\nyour relationships to the success or failure of your career; now it is time to\nfigure out who puts food on your table. Your clients and employers are the\npeople who are the Santa to your Christmas, the quarter in your candy\ndispenser, and the banker in your real-life Monopoly game.\n\nA couple years ago, I got into a deep conversation with one of the vice\npresidents in our agency. As we started discussing the history of our business\nand where our valuable referrals had come from, I grabbed a marker—as I often\ndo—and headed to the dry erase board. I began to plot out the initial contacts\nwe had in the early days of our business, and then I proceeded to draw lines\nconnecting them to the people they had referred us to over the years. It began\nto look something like a company organizational chart.\n\n![Image](../images/00096.jpeg)\n\nAs I took another look at it, I realized that it was more like a genealogy\ntree. Who would have thought that family history concepts could be applied to\nbusiness! In the end, we had five years worth of referred clients and contacts\nmapped out on the board with lines connecting them together like a\nkindergarten craft project. What that genealogy revealed to us was nothing\nshort of mind boggling: One initial contact from the early days of our\nbusiness had been the seed of about 25 percent of all total business we had\nreceived moving forward over the years.\n\nAs a whole, our company has not spent much money on traditional advertising.\nWhat we have done is spend our money investing into our genealogy tree. This\nis the list of people who have actually given us work and paid us money! We\nregularly take clients to lunch, treat them to a round of golf, send them gift\nbaskets, recognize their birthdays, and many other things to keep this list of\ninvaluable people aware of us, as well as to let them know that we value and\nappreciate them. Before you spend hard-earned money trying to market your\nservices in a magazine or billboard, first consider ways to spend money on\nyour client genealogy tree.\n\nIn order to best leverage your relationships, you must understand your\ncompany’s genealogy. Start with the very first client or two that gave you\nwork. Put them on a piece of paper, draw a box around their names, and then\ndraw a line to someone they referred you to. Figure out your client genealogy\nand then make sure you keep those people happy—after all, chances are high\nthat they are the source of your greatest personal revenue streams.\n\n\n## 67\\. Never Give Your Client Homework\n\nOver the past several years, we have been on retainer with TV Guide. Our\nstrong relationship has definitely been win-win; they need us, and we need and\nappreciate them as one of our most active and long-term clients. A few weeks\nago, we had a face-to-face meeting with them in which we discussed one of the\nbig projects our team was in the process of executing for them.\n\nDuring the meeting, I told the execs that we would need to have all of the\nproject details broken down into To-Do items, which we would then add to our\nproduction management software. Our team would then be able to work off of\nthose To-Do items to successfully manage all of the project details. For a\nsecond, the VP of the group looked at us like a deer in the headlights and I\nrealized that he thought we were asking for his team to come up with all the\nTo-Do items. He was likely thinking, “How in the world are we going to find\nthe time to break down the project to that level of detail? And even though we\nhave access to your production management software, we aren’t very good at\nusing it and don’t have time in our day to figure it out.”\n\n![Image](../images/00097.jpeg)\n\nI could almost hear those thoughts coming out of his head, and I quickly said,\n“You give us the tasks, changes, information but in any format you want.\nWhether it is a phone call, email, text message, instant message...you could\nwrite things on a napkin for all we care.",

We’ll convert every request into a\nTo-Do item, add it to our project management software, and work from that\nlist.” He exclaimed without hesitation, “THANK GOODNESS!” I could tell that I\nhad struck the right chord, so I continued by saying, “We are here to make\nyour life easier. We’ll take care of all the details. Just feed them to us in\nwhatever way is easiest, fastest, and least stressful for you.”\n\nAlways remember that graphic design is a service-based business. In most\ncases, your client hired you because they are stressed out and need your help;\ngiving them “homework” assignments only adds to their stress, and makes you\nlook incompetent and unprepared to handle every aspect of their project.\n\nOf course, there will be times when you need to ask your client to do things.\nIn these cases, you can try to make it as easy on them as possible by\ngathering or prefilling as much of the required information as you can. Here\nare a few examples.\n\n**Project content:** You are building a website for a client. Your client\nneeds to send you the copy for the project. Instead of asking the client to\nemail the copy to you, think about how you can make it easier for them.\nPerhaps you could prefill a Word document with all of the copy from their\ncurrent site and email them that copy with a message like, “We are at a point\nin the project where we need the copy for your new website. To make this as\neasy as possible for you, we took the copy from your current site and pasted\nit into the attached Word document. We know you are planning to change a lot\nof that content on your new site, but hopefully this will help make it easier\nfor you. Please let us know how we can help.”\n\n**Project images:** It is time for photos to be added to the brochure you are\ndesigning for your client. You might be tempted to email the client and ask\nthem to send the images they want to include in the brochure. Don’t fall for\nthat temptation. Instead, think of a way that could make it easiest for the\nclient. You could say, “We are ready for the final images to be chosen for the\nbrochure. The final design has room for seven photos. Two of the photos are\nthe ones you sent at the start of the project, which means we’ll need some\nstock photos for the other five. We have set up a lightbox on the stock photo\nsite we use and filled it with a dozen or so options. If you don’t find five\nimages in there that you would like to use, you can easily add additional\nphotos to the lightbox and we can chat them over. Here is the information\nneeded to access the lightbox...”\n\n**Prefilled bad-word filter:** Recently my company created an online\napplication for a kid company. The application had several submission forms,\nand due to the fact that it was a form targeting children, a bad-word filter\nwas required. Instead of saying to the client, “We are ready for you to send\nus the bad words you want to include in the filter,” we said something like,\n“We are creating the bad-word filter for the application.

The document contains a series of questions\nthat help us get on the same page as our client. We discuss the Creative Brief\nwith the client on the phone or in a face-to-face meeting. Prior to the call\nwe fill the document with all of the information we currently know about the\nproject. Oftentimes, we’ll even put in our assumptions about the project and\nask the client for confirmation. We never send the empty document to the\nclient asking them to complete it.\n\n![Image](../images/00098.jpeg)\n\nThese are just a few examples of the types of things we see in our business.\nThe types of clients and projects in your business will likely be different,\nand there will inevitably be times when your client will need to provide you\nwith parts of the project. But the message is the same for everyone: Do\neverything you can to keep the things you need your client to do at a minimum.\nAfter all, they hired you to do the job. The more you do without their\nassistance, the easier you’ll make their life.\n\n\n## 68\\. Assume That People Are Clueless\n\nOne of the best things a designer can do is assume that people are clueless.\nAnd for the most part, in this context the clueless people are your clients.\nNow I am not positing that your clients are literally mindless morons—chances\nare they are very intelligent and successful business people. However, graphic\ndesigners often err by assuming that their clients know way more than they do\nabout what the heck is going on regarding the design process and their role in\nit. Assumptions are frequently made that your clients understand how to give\nfeedback, what they are looking at, what is coming next in the project, and so\nforth; these assumptions are usually way off base.\n\nMost of the time, your client does not understand what it takes to execute\ntheir project. They probably don’t know how to give good feedback. Your client\ndoesn’t know what the next steps are. There is frequently no understanding of\nthe graphic design process at all. And unfortunately, the best chance for\nsuccess in every project stems from a working relationship where the designer\nand client work together as partners. You must understand their needs and they\nmust understand how you will work to satisfy those needs. In every phase of\nthe project, it is safest to assume that your client is clueless, thus your\njob is to teach them along the way so that they can successfully play their\nrole in the project.\n\nThere are three key areas in which your client may need your help to\nunderstand their role as it relates to their project.\n\n**Your client may need your help understanding what they are looking at.** You\nmust assume that your clients have basic computer knowledge and little\nunderstanding of graphic design elements. If you are meeting with a client\nface-to-face, teaching them about what they are looking at is easier than\nhaving to explain yourself every time you have a conversation with them about\ncomps or revisions. If you are emailing elements to your client, then you must\nassume they are clueless and explain to them what they are looking at. Here\nare some examples to help you get the gist of this mindset and how to\ncorrectly implement it into your business practices.\n\n**(Bad) Assuming too much:** “Attached are the logo comps for review.”\n\n**(Good) Assuming they are clueless:** “Attached is a ten-page PDF of your\nlogos. The first page contains all the logos on one page.",

Clicking the link below will open your browser window to view\nthe comps. Please keep in mind that these comps are nonfunctioning images\nonly. That means that buttons and other elements will not work at this phase\nof the project.”\n\n(You’d be surprised how many clients try clicking on comps because they don’t\nunderstand the static nature of a comp.)\n\n**Your client may need your help understanding what you require of them.**\nOnce they have passed the proverbial design baton to you, even seasoned\nclients may have no real understanding of what their role in their project\nentails. You have a responsibility to educate them as to the best way for them\nto provide feedback and assets, and then you must learn how to manage their\nexpectations. Failure to help them with these things can cause projects to\nblow up and can even result in you losing out on future business from that\nclient.\n\n**(Bad) Assuming too much:** “We look forward to your feedback on the attached\nlogo comps.”\n\n**(Good) Assuming they are clueless:** “To help us arrive at the best logo\ndesign for your company, please consider the following when providing your\nfeedback. Which logos do you like and why? Which logos do you dislike and why?\nWhich color choices and combinations do you feel are closest to what you\ndesire for your logo? Are there elements on different logos that you would\nlike us to mix and match (perhaps the type on one logo and the mark on\nanother)?”\n\n(These types of questions help lead the client to provide the best feedback,\nand eliminates the blanket, unhelpful feedback designers the world over dread,\nsuch as “We just don’t like any of these.”)\n\n**(Bad) Assuming too much:** “We are now ready to begin building your website.\nPlease send us assets so we can integrate them into the functioning site\npages.”\n\n**(Good) Assuming they are clueless:** “We are now ready to begin building\nyour website.

The reality is that many (if not\nmost) of your clients are extremely sharp, super talented, and successful\nindividuals (in their respective field).

Long-Term Relationship Value vs. Single Transaction Profit\n\nWhile serving as creative director for the online divisions of Fox Kids and\nFox Family in the early 2000s, we hired an outside agency to do some layout\nwork for our new style guide. The agency was highly recommended by another\ntrusted vendor, so we didn’t even get a competitive estimate. They sent in\ntheir price at $40,000 for the project and we immediately gave the project the\ngreen light. Their initial comps were spot on, and we were excited about the\ndirection they were headed with the design. Over the course of a few weeks, my\nteam sent over the content we wanted in the style guide and they flowed it\ninto the templates we had approved. Everything was proceeding nicely. When we\narrived at the end of the project, the style guide layout was beautiful and we\nwere all happy with the results.\n\nThen the agency sent over their invoice, which included a surprise “Change\nOrder” for $20,000 on top of the $40,000 price we had agreed upon! Their\njustification was that the original estimate was for a certain number of pages\nand the content we sent them exceeded what they had bid on. Admittedly, their\nclaim was true. The style guide ended up being many pages longer than any of\nus had anticipated.\n\nMy frustration was that they never once mentioned to us that they would need\nto increase the budget to accommodate the increase in scope of work. They were\nalways more than happy to lay out whatever content we sent over to them\nwithout even a whisper to indicate that we were beginning to exceed the\ninitial proposed amount of work; we proceeded under the assumption that the\nbudget was still intact.\n\nA few of us from our team had a conference call with the owner of their agency\nand the people assigned to our account. I asked about what world they live in\nwhere they think they can increase the cost of the project by 50 percent\nwithout ever mentioning to their client that they were incurring extra fees.\nThe owner of the agency said that, “Even at $60,000, the project was still a\nsteal of a deal by any stretch of the imagination.” However, he failed to\nunderstand that my frustration was rooted in the principle of the situation,\nnot in the cost.\n\nWe ended up being able to gain approval for the increased budget and we paid\nthe invoice. Guess what? I have never once considered using that agency again.\nThey sold out a chance to receive any future work for a measly $20,000. I\nspent the next couple years working at Fox—where our department had an annual\nbudget in the millions of dollars—none of which went to that agency. Then I\nstarted my own agency, which, over time, grew to be larger than the agency\nthat sent us the ridiculous change order. My agency has sent out millions of\ndollars worth of invoices and has outsourced hundreds of thousands of dollars\nthroughout our years in business. Not once did I ever consider using that\nagency, even though their work and the finished product were excellent.\n\nThis situation may sound like it’s got a bit of vindictiveness on my part, but\nknow that I’m not a spiteful person; it was the lack of business tact in the\ndelivery of the change order that I didn’t appreciate. It seems this agency\ndidn’t understand that in business, a long-term relationship typically has\nmore value than any profits a single transaction may generate.\n\nRecently, we had a new client approach us to do some work. This client shared\nwith us a few stories about how he had been burned by change orders from his\nprevious agency. His biggest complaint was that they never charged what they\ncommitted in their proposal. Every invoice included extra change fees and\nadditional charges. We, of course, promised that this would not be the case\nwith us. However, in order to ensure that our clients know they will never be\nsurprised by our agency, we added the following term to our proposal.\n\n_“The Client shall be responsible for making additional payments for changes\nrequested by the Client that are outside the original assignment. An estimate\nfor these additional charges will be approved by the Client before any work is\ndone. No additional payment shall be made for changes required to conform to\nthe original assignment description.”_\n\nUnfortunately, the graphic design and advertising world is filled with people\nwho charge extra fees that were not agreed upon by the client. This\nrelationship-damaging practice is a detriment to your career growth.",

The project was big, and it was\nright up our alley. After all, we work with clients like Disney, Warner Bros.,\nFox, Sony, and such. We were a great choice for them, and our whole team was\nexcited about the prospect. We sent our first estimate, just shy of $300,000,\nto get things rolling. Although they ended up green lighting a much lower\nprice due to scope revisions, there was no sticker shock with the initial\nproposal. Moreover, the client was an advertising agency, and we were\nconvinced this was going to be a great project. How could they be a bad client\nwhen they walk in our shoes every day? We expected nothing but smooth sailing\nand a successful working relationship.\n\nThen the oddities started. Just before they officially signed off on the\nproposal, the agency asked us to complete a personality test for everyone on\nour team. They claimed they wanted to know who they were working with and—in a\ncondescending manner—made us feel like this was commonplace with the big “ad\nagencies.” We humbly agreed to complete their personality test and admittedly\nfelt like we were out of the loop. “I guess all the big ad agencies make their\nvendors complete personality tests prior to working together,” we thought.\nThey sent over the tests in PDF format and our team members began choosing\nadjectives in a series of rows and columns to define their personality in the\nworkplace. We sent the completed tests back to the client and anxiously\nawaited the results.\n\nThey were pleased that our agency had a good mix of personality types. Each\nemployee had been categorized into four personality buckets. We had fun at our\noffice finding out the results and teasing each other about our respective\npersonalities. The client began asking questions about how the project would\nbe run in our shop and who would be working on things on our side. We wanted\nan all-star team on the project and told them we would have our art director\nrun point. He was our best project manager, and all of our clients loved\nworking with him. They replied that they didn’t want him to work on the\nproject because he wasn’t the right type of personality. (Keep in mind, they\nhad never once met him or spoken with him in person or otherwise.) They wanted\nsomeone else from our team to manage the project on our side. This should have\nbeen a _huge_ red flag that this client relationship was going to be a\ndisaster.\n\n* * *\n\nODD BEHAVIOR\n\nAT THE START OF A PROJECT\n\nIS ALMOST ALWAYS\n\nGOING TO YIELD\n\nMORE ODD BEHAVIOR\n\nDURING AND AT THE END\n\nOF THE PROJECT.\n\n* * *\n\nWe had seen our art director manage hundreds of projects during his few years\nwith our company. We knew he was the man for the job. But we caved. We let\nthem tell us how to run our company based on a five-minute personality survey.\nWe assigned the person they chose to be the lead on the project. He wasn’t an\nawful choice by any means, but he did not have the same level of project\nmanagement skills as our art director.\n\nWe kicked off the project and got to work. The next eight months were filled\nwith nothing but turmoil. The client revised the scope three times after\nkickoff. They were not willing to pay us for pieces of the project they\ncancelled after we began working on them. We had weekly phone calls, mostly\nasking them for assets that were almost always late. And in the end, they made\na request to cut the entire project in half. We jumped through hoop after hoop\nin an effort to accommodate this client. Finally, we had enough and made the\ndecision to part ways as amicably as possible.\n\nIn retrospect, the odd behavior exhibited at the start of the project should\nhave been a crystal ball for us. We should have had some backbone and made\nsure we ran our business as we knew how. What kind of client thinks they can\ntell you how to run your business based on a five-minute personality test?\n\nThe moral of this bizarre but true story is that too often we as designers are\ntoo accommodating for our clients.

Don’t Be the Desperate Girlfriend\n\nThink back to high school. Remember the girl or guy who seemed “unattainable?”\nYou know, the one everyone seemed to have a crush on? I am willing to bet that\nthere was never a time when that person came across as being “desperate.” On\nthe contrary, that person probably seemed perfectly happy and confident with\nor without your adoration. I’m not a psychologist, but perhaps this lack of\ndesperation is one of the attributes that made this person so desirable.\n\nAs a freelancer or agency owner, keeping business coming in is an ongoing\nactivity. If you want to be successful, it is imperative that you have at\nleast a few clients who provide regular work to your business. “Selling” to\nthese clients should be first on your list of priorities. The challenge is\napproaching them with the right message.\n\nIf you come right out and ask for work, you could appear desperate. I have\nstooped to this level only once in my career (so far). It was in the height of\nthe recession in 2009. NBC Universal was our biggest client from the previous\nyear and they hadn’t sent one project to us in 2009. Along with the rest of\nthe service-oriented businesses in the world, we were nervous and getting\ndesperate. I sent an instant message to my closest contact at NBC and said,\n“I’m unabashedly messaging you to try to drum up work. Got anything?” I didn’t\nmind looking desperate to this contact and knew that our relationship could\ntake it. Unfortunately, we don’t have this type of open relationship with all\nour clients and a little more tact is advised when looking to generate\nbusiness.\n\nThe most successful way we’ve found to ask for work without actually “asking”\nfor work is a simple message to a client:\n\n“We were just reviewing our production schedule for the next quarter. We’ve\nreally enjoyed working on projects with you and are curious as to what your\nplans are for next quarter. Please let us know what you see on the horizon\nwhen you get a free moment. We want to make sure we have production bandwidth\navailable for you as the need arises.”\n\n(Obviously, this message should be customized to fit your tone and timing.\nInstead of “next quarter,” you may ask about the next “week,” “month,” or\n“year.”)\n\nThe goal of this message is to get an idea of what your client may have coming\nyour way. It also serves as a friendly reminder that you exist and that you\nare ready and willing to help them when they need you. Essentially, it is a\ngood way to try to drum up work without acting like a desperate sixteen-year-\nold looking for a date to the prom.\n\n![Image](../images/00100.jpeg)",

The longer you stand in the manure, the more you will begin to\nstink. It makes no difference whether it is your manure or not; the fact is\nthat you are knee deep in it and you will begin to reek of it.\n\nSometimes projects go south. It doesn’t matter how great a project manager you\nare, there will come a time over the course of your graphic design career when\nyou find yourself knee deep in a disaster of a project. It could be your\nfault. It could be your client’s fault. Perhaps it is even a third party’s\nfault. Where the fault lies doesn’t make any difference—what matters is that\nthe project is off track, your client is frustrated, and you are guilty by\nassociation. As a result, everyone begins to smell. To you, your client reeks\nof manure. In the eyes of your client, your stench is unbearable. All parties\ninvolved are frustrated with each other and this is difficult to recover from.\n\nA good friend of mine runs a small design agency in Tennessee. It seems he\ncalls me about once a quarter to pick my brain on an issue he is dealing with.\nOn one particular occasion, he was waist high in a manure pile.\n\nHis company had built an online game for Fox’s hit show, “American Idol.” The\ngame was working great and ready to go live. The only problem was integration\nof the banner ads into the Flash game: The banner ad company provided ad code\nto the client. The client sent the code to my friend’s programmers. My\nfriend’s programmers put it in the game. It didn’t work. My friend told the\nclient there was a problem with the banner ad code. The banner ad company told\nthe client that there was a problem with the game.\n\nI’m sure the client didn’t know whom to believe. And it really didn’t matter\nwho was at fault. Both my friend’s company and the banner ad company looked\nbad. And to top it all off, the client looked bad too. Everyone involved was\nstanding in manure. In the end, my friend’s team figured out the problem, got\neverything working, and saved the day, but it was too late. They were now\nassociated with a disaster project; the smell of manure had seeped into their\npores, and to the client, they smelled worse than a pig farm on a hot summer’s\nday. I doubt that client will be hiring a stinky vendor anytime soon.\n\n![Image](../images/00101.jpeg)\n\nHere are a few keys to keeping yourself and your company smelling like roses.\n\n**Avoid manure.** Communication is the key to avoiding manure. Make sure your\nclient always knows where you stand on projects, what challenges you are\nconfronting, when they will be seeing things, and so forth. If there are third\nparties involved, make sure you have their contact info from the start of the\nproject. That way, if something goes awry, you can communicate directly with\nthe third party involved instead of using the client as a middleman.\n\n**Get out of manure fast.** If you have a project that goes haywire, don’t\ndelay getting back on track. View your client as a partner in the process and\ncontact them as soon as you realize you are in manure. Explain the situation\nand ask them, “What can we do to get things rolling smoothly again?” Effective\ncommunication can get you out of a manure pile better than anything else.\n\n**Send your client some soap.** I didn’t have to grow up on a farm to know\nthat soap helps when you smell like manure. If you have a project that has\ngone amuck and your client is getting smelly, there is a good chance that you\nare getting smelly, too. Soap is the best way to clean off the stink. The kind\nof soap I’m talking about is something that presents an added benefit for the\nclient. For example, you could add some new features to the project.\nDiscounting pricing always helps put you in a good light, as well. You could\nalso send a gift of some kind to the client. Be creative and do what is\nappropriate.\n\nKnow that when a project goes bad, whether it is your fault or not, you look\nbad and need to take drastic measures if necessary to begin smelling sweetly\nonce again.\n\n* * *\n\nYOU ABSOLUTELY\n\nHAVE A RIGHT\n\nTO FIRE YOUR CLIENT.\n\n* * *",

The company\nstruggled financially and the leadership was questionable at times. But I did\nlearn a few lessons while enduring my time there. In a discussion about how to\nwork with a difficult client, the president of the company offered up this\nadvice.\n\n_“Never fire a client. Just raise the price on them. Then they will either be\nspending so much with you that they will be worth the pain they inflict on\nyou, or they will not agree to pay the higher prices and they’ll leave on\ntheir own. Either way, you win.”_\n\nCertainly this advice is worth considering. We’ve tried it a couple times with\nmixed results. In some cases, the client pays the higher fees. In other cases,\nthey go away. And in other instances, the client gets frustrated.\n\nMost of our production team members do some freelance work, and they sometimes\noutsource work to each other. In one case, one of our current programmers\nasked one of our ex-programmers for a price quote to do some work for him on a\nsmall freelance job. The ex-programmer came back with an estimate that, when\nbroken down into an hourly rate, amounted to $1,000 per hour. Our current\nprogrammer who requested the estimate was frustrated and exclaimed, “If you\ndon’t want to do the work, just say so! Don’t send an insulting price.”\n\n![Image](../images/00102.jpeg)\n\nThis is the only way the “Never Fire a Client” advice can backfire, so be\ncareful when you follow it. It is definitely not applicable to every scenario.\nSometimes it is just better to say “no thanks” to a client than to go through\nthe frustration and turmoil that can come down the pike later. If the client\nis one you have had for some time, you will have to take that relationship\ninto consideration, as it is likely that more is at stake than just their\ncurrent business with you (such as potential referrals or bigger, better jobs\ndown the road that may make working with them more worthwhile than it is\ncurrently).\n\n![Image](../images/00103.jpeg)\n\n\n## 74\\. “We Decided to Go Another Direction” Means “You Suck”\n\nYou put your heart and soul into a proposal. Sometimes you even fly out to see\nthe client and make a fancy pitch. In the end, there are times when you are\nnot selected to do the work. The client tries to let you down easily by\ntelling you, “We decided to go in another direction.” If I had a dollar for\nevery time I heard that phrase, I’d be a rich man. We’ve learned to interpret\nwhat the client really means when they say it: “You suck, and we’re just\ntrying to let you down easy.”\n\nAt the start of my business when we would hear that from clients, we would\nsimply say, “Thanks for considering us. Please let us know if we can help you\nout in the future.” Then we’d sit and speculate as to why we weren’t chosen to\ndo the work.\n\n![Image](../images/00104.jpeg)\n\nSpeculation is healthy and can lead to improvement. However, nothing will help\nyou land the next project with that client better than reacting to the facts.\nAnd to get the facts, you have to ask.\n\n“Thanks for considering us. It was a pleasure putting the proposal together\nfor you. We are always looking to improve our business and are curious as to\nwhat the determining factors were for your choice. Was our price too high?\nDoes the agency you chose have more applicable experience? Any feedback would\nbe very appreciated so that we can prepare ourselves to serve you better in\nthe future. Thanks!”\n\nYou likely put several hours into trying to land the project, so you have a\nright to know why you weren’t chosen. If the client truly considers you a\nviable resource for future projects, they will answer your questions. Your\ndesire to improve your business and react positively to their feedback will\nalso be a feather in your cap, as the client will see your dedication.\n\nThese are the most common reasons you will not win a proposal:\n\n**Price.** Far too often, clients make their choice based completely on price.",

If you don’t know a budget\nrange, for some ideas see the chapter titled “[How to Flush Out a\nBudget](part0097.html#ch086)” in [Section 5](part0089.html#part05).\n\n**Confidence.** Another determining factor is confidence. The client simply\nbelieves that someone else is more equipped to handle the job. This could be\nbased on company size. It could be based on related experience. It could also\nbe based on a gut feeling. But nothing makes you feel like you suck more than\nsomeone else being chosen because they are deemed to be more capable.\n\n**Relationship.** Our focus on creating relationships has won us numerous\nprojects. On the flip side, we have also lost many projects due to not having\na strong relationship with the client. There are times where a request for\nproposal is sent out with the sole intention of reinforcing a decision to go\nwith their preselected Vendor X. Your proposal is compared to that of the\npreselected vendor and everyone in the room says, “See, we absolutely should\ngo with Vendor X.” In these instances, the client may not even reply to your\ninquiry about why you were not chosen. (Come to think of it, in most of these\ncases the client doesn’t even reply to your proposal delivery message.) You\nhave simply been a pawn in their little game. When all other things are equal,\nthe client will choose the person they have the best relationship with almost\nevery time.\n\n**Interest Level.** One time when we lost a project to another agency, we\nasked the client why they decided to go in another direction. Their response\nwas disheartening to us. “You guys had a great portfolio. Your price was right\non target. It’s just that some of the other agencies showed more interest in\nour project. So we decided to go with one of them.” In other words, we failed\nto express enough enthusiasm to win the job. In order to land work, you must\nshow genuine excitement for the client’s project. Your passion will be\ninfectious and help the client feel your willingness to go the extra mile for\nthem.\n\nDon’t just roll over and be abused by potential clients who don’t choose you.\nDo everything in your power to improve your bidding process by asking the\nclient for simple feedback as to why you were not selected. They owe you that.",

There Are Such Things as Stupid Questions\n\nWith most of my company’s clients located in a different state than where I\nreside, I do a bit more than my fair share of traveling. One of my favorite\nplaces to visit is New York City. I absolutely love the energy in that great\ncity, and I delight in exploring all of the great places to eat. On a side\nnote, if you have never been to the New York area’s Junior’s restaurants, do\nyourself a favor and add them to your list of “must eat” places. No need to\nlook at the menu at the Times Square spot; order “Something Different”\n(featuring a pile of juicy brisket sandwiched between two potato pancakes\ntopped with gravy and applesauce...mmmmmmmmm...) and then polish it off with a\nslice of delectable “Devil’s Food Cheesecake.”\n\nDuring a recent trip, my family and I were “enjoying” questionable service at\nanother Times Square restaurant (not my beloved Junior’s). Once I realized\nthat our service level was in question, I became hypersensitive to our\nserver’s performance. After an overly long wait, she dropped off our food and\nwalked past the table next to us. Surprisingly, she noticed that this guest’s\nDiet Coke was empty. He still had over half of his food left to finish so she\nasked, “Would you like a refill?”\n\n![Image](../images/00105.jpeg)\n\nPerhaps you might consider this adequate service. I, however, considered this\nan obvious question and a missed opportunity. “OF COURSE, he would like a\nrefill!” I thought. “He still has half his food left to eat and nothing to\nwash it down with!” Had she brought him a brand new drink without asking\nfirst, I am certain he would have appreciated her service all the more. Or at\nthe least, so he’d have the opportunity to respond she could have told him her\nplan to replenish his soda in advance, saying “I’m going to grab a refill of\nyour drink, I’ll be back in a second. Need anything else?”\n\nBeing a graphic designer, like being a waiter (and countless other service-\noriented professions), is a career path that is filled with opportunities to\nanticipate the needs of your customers and fill them without asking obvious\nquestions.\n\nFor example, a client comes to your office and spends 45 minutes talking to\nyou about their company. You can tell that their voice is getting a little\nscratchy. Don’t ask them if they want some water; find an opportune moment to\ninterject and say, “Just a minute, let me grab a water for you.” (We have a\nmini-fridge in our conference room that is always stocked with handy beverages\nfor this very reason.)\n\nOr perhaps you are talking with a new client. You are excited about the new\nproject and ready to get rolling. Don’t ask them questions like, “Are you in a\nhurry to start this project?” (Nine times out of ten they are in a rush.)\n\nInstead, tell them, “I’m sure you are anxious to get this project going. Here\nis how the production schedule will play out...”\n\nLikewise, imagine you are at the end of the design phase of a website project\nand ready to start programming, but the client has a few final tweaks. Don’t\nask them, “Would you like us to make your changes to the comps and send you a\nrevised version? Or, would you like us to just implement the changes when we\nbuild out the site?”\n\nInstead take the initiative and say, “We’ve taken detailed notes of these\nchanges. Since they are minor, we’ll just plan on making them when we build\nout the functioning website pages.”\n\nIt is always better to anticipate your client’s needs and proactively present\nyour plan to satisfy those needs than it is to ask your client stupid\nquestions. Not only will it save you potential embarrassment, but it will set\nyou up to be a hero in your client’s eyes.",

My wife pulled a thread that led to tearing out walls, rerouting\nplumbing, and redoing electrical. Destruction, dust, and debris are slowly\nmanifesting into a beautiful new kitchen, foyer and family room that our\nfamily is looking forward to enjoying. We have learned many lessons throughout\nthe process, one of which is that you can’t get mad at math. Two plus two\nequals four every time. There is no denying it. There is no arguing with it.\n\nWhen it came time to refinish our hardwood floors during this process, our\ncontractor told us that we would need to be out of the home for 24 hours while\nthe floors dried. As much as we would have preferred not to have the\ndisruption in our lives, there was no denying the fact that it takes 24 hours\nfor the finish to cure. The numbers are the numbers.\n\nAt the end of the process, I received the final invoice from the contractor.\nIt was several thousand dollars more than expected. I knew we had made plenty\nof extra requests along the way; I just didn’t know what the final costs of\nthose requests would be. Each item was itemized in detail:\n\n• Custom wood floor vents $100 each × 6 = $600\n\n• Replace silver hinges on all doors $35 × 5 = $175\n\n• Add crown molding to living room $350\n\n• Assist kitchen cabinet installers 2 hours @ $65/hour = $130\n\n• Etc.\n\nWhile reviewing the itemized list of requests, services, and hours, it became\nclear that we owed the full amount and my initial sticker shock dissipated.\nThe math was the math. There was no arguing with it. There was no getting mad\nat it. Explaining the math behind a production request can often diffuse an\notherwise emotional situation.\n\nSome time ago, our agency had a retainer with TD Ameritrade. We had created\nsome branding elements, marketing materials, and presentations during the\ncourse of the retainer. Our design team created one of the PowerPoint decks\nthat was an astonishingly large 1,820 pages. The production cycle had lasted a\nfew weeks and the team was one day away from completion of the final document\nwhen an unwelcome request came in from the client. “Can you change...” They\nhad asked for a global change to the design style that would require\nmodifications on all 1,820 pages.\n\nCharged with emotion and fear, our lead designer came to me in a panic, “This\nis going to take forever! What do we say to them? We don’t want them to get\nmad if we say we can’t do it. We don’t want to stay up all night for the next\ncouple nights to get this finished.” I explained to her this math principle\nand together we crafted a “you can’t get mad at math” email to the client.\n\n_Joe,_\n\n_We are excited to be wrapping up this project. We’re all proud of the work\ncompleted._\n\n_Thank you for the change request. We understand that design changes happen,\nand we know that there are a lot of decision-makers that you are striving to\nplease._\n\n_Needless to say, this is a big request and we have very little time left.\nYour requested change will need to be made to all 1,820 slides in the\npresentation. If we work as fast as possible and have no glitches along the\nway, we might be able to complete it in 30 seconds per slide. That totals\n54,600 seconds (or 910 minutes or 15 hours). We have only three business hours\nleft before the deadline. We just don’t see how we can accommodate this\nrequest and retain a high level of quality in the process. We hope you\nunderstand._\n\n_We look forward to your response._\n\n_Thanks!_\n\n_Janet_\n\nOff the email went and we eagerly awaited the clients reaction. Within just a\nfew minutes they replied, “We understand it is big request and the timeline is\ntight. Thank you for your explanation. Do what you can.”\n\nThere was no anger. They weren’t upset with us. The math was the math, and\nspelling it out for them helped them see things our way. We made as many\nchanges as we could within the time available and the client was satisfied\nwith our efforts.",

This student was graduating soon and was preparing to begin spamming out\nrésumés. We receive an enormous amount of resumes from people wanting to work\nat our agency. I offered the student a little advice on our unofficial\nprocess: You have about 65 seconds to land a job.\n\n**1st:** We skim the email letter; hopefully it is custom written for our\nagency. (Takes about 5 seconds.)\n\n_If the candidate passes that..._\n\n**2nd:** We look at the résumé; hopefully we will find a PDF attached. Is it\nnicely designed? Is there a custom logo? Did they pay attention to typography?\n(Takes about 10 seconds.)\n\n_If the candidate passes that..._\n\n**3rd:** We actually read the résumé, looking for buzzwords of skills and\nexperience that we feel would add value to our business. (Takes about 20\nseconds.)\n\n_If the candidate passes that..._\n\n**4th:** We look for a link to a website portfolio. We want to see digital\nsamples online with a custom domain name. We’re not a fan of email-attachment\nsamples or generic online gallery templates. (Takes about 30 seconds to 1\nminute.)\n\n_If the candidate passes that..._\n\n![Image](../images/00106.jpeg)\n\n**5th:** We look for salary requirements in the cover letter or email. If we\ndon’t find them we ask our office manager to email the candidate to ask for a\nsalary range.\n\n_If the candidate passes that..._\n\n**6th:** We ask our office manager to set up an interview and we flag the\ncandidate’s email to help us remember them.\n\n_If the candidate passes that..._\n\n**7th:** We have an interview.\n\n_If the candidate passes that..._\n\n**8th:** The candidate gets a job!\n\nI assume that the way we plow through the onslaught of résumés coming to our\nagency is not dissimilar to most other agencies. So take care in writing a\ncustom email, preparing your résumé, and creating an eye-catching portfolio\nwebsite. You likely have only a few seconds of the hiring manager’s time, so\nmake them count!\n\n\n## 78\\. How to Ask for a Raise Without Asking for a Raise\n\nI’ve asked for a raise only once in my career, and in retrospect, I was an\nidiot for doing so. The company I was with was struggling.

Like a junior-minded, brainless employee, I decided that I should\ngo plead my case as to why I felt I should be earning more money. The new\ncompany head heard my case and took it under consideration. A few short weeks\nlater, I was laid off along with the rest of my production team. I am\nconfident that my being laid off had nothing to do with me asking for a raise.\nHowever, in hindsight, I am certain that I looked like a total dolt for even\nasking.

Why didn’t I see the writing on the wall? The company just underwent a\ntotal reorganization due to previous bad management. A little patience and\nwillingness to wait for the proverbial dust to settle would have been a better\nplay on my part.\n\nOne time, during the Great Recession, one of our team members came to ask for\na raise. Our company, like many others, had cash flow but only enough to keep\nthings rolling. Raises and bonuses were not going to happen until we recouped\nsome of the nest egg money that we used to keep everyone employed in the first\nplace. This employee tried a few different approaches. First was the pity\nparty: “I’m living on ramen noodles.” Second was the proud party: “I can code\ncircles around everyone in the office.” None of these efforts changed the fact\nthat this programmer surprised us with his request. And by not prepping us, he\nimmediately put himself in an adversarial relationship. He was expecting a\nraise on the spot. We didn’t have raises on the mind or in the budget to react\npositively to the employee’s request. In the end, the employee walked away\nfrustrated and we were left wondering if the employee was going to go look for\nanother job or lose his dedication to our company.\n\nIn fact, when you ask for a raise in this manner it almost always creates an\nawkward situation and a potential contentious relationship with your boss.\nThere is a way, however, to ask for a raise without asking for a raise.\nImagine a conversation like this in a brief closed-door meeting.\n\n**Employee:** “I just wanted to come in and let you know that I love working\nat this company. The team is great. I love the work. I look forward to coming\nin every day.”\n\n**Boss:** “That’s great to hear. You’ve been a great contributor to our\nprojects here.”\n\n**Employee:** “I’m glad to hear you say that; I’m working hard. I wanted to\ntalk with you for a minute and let you know that I view myself being here\nlong-term and I was wondering what steps I should be taking to be able to earn\nfuture raises and promotions. I’m not asking for a raise now; I want to make\nsure I earn it. I just want to get on the same page with you about the types\nof things you are looking for out of me so that when the time comes for\nraises, I’ll deserve one.”\n\n**Boss:** “Great. I appreciate you taking the initiative to ask that. Here are\na few things I’d love to see from you...”\n\n**Employee (takes notes):** “Awesome. I’m going to work on these things. Do\nyou mind if we meet again next month and talk about how I’m progressing with\nyour expectations?”\n\n**Boss:** “That’d be great. I’d love to chat again. Thanks again for bringing\nthis up.”\n\nThis type of conversation accomplishes a few things:\n\nFirst, your boss now knows that you are looking to make more money. But you\ndidn’t ask for money, so they are left with that on their radar. Most bosses\nwill take a minute to consider your current salary and may even look at the\nbudget numbers to see what a raise would look like for you (in preparation for\nthe future conversation).\n\n* * *\n\nASKING FOR A RAISE\n\nIS TRICKY BUSINESS.\n\nTIMING AND TECHNIQUE ARE\n\nCRITICAL TO YOUR SUCCESS\n\nIN RECEIVING A RAISE\n\nWITHOUT DAMAGING\n\nA RELATIONSHIP\n\nIN THE PROCESS.\n\n* * *\n\nSecond, you have paved a way for future salary discussions.

SOMETHING BAD IS GOING TO HAPPEN.\n\n\n## 79\\. Do What You Love; the Money Will Follow\n\nNot unlike many other graphic designers, I was the kid in high school who\ncould draw. I aced all the art classes and thoroughly enjoyed the creative\nprocess. During my first year of college, however, I had yet to decide on a\nmajor. I attended Indiana University, which consistently is one of the top-\nranked business schools in the country. Many of my friends planned to major in\nbusiness. Like an unoriginal sheep I followed along, leaving behind my\nprevious plan of studying commercial art (a.k.a. graphic design). My grades\nand interest in school suffered as I pursued a course of study that I thought\nwould lead to a more financially secure future. I am certain that I spent more\ntime horsing around during my freshman year than I did going to class. But who\ncould blame me? Some of those prebusiness school classes were boring enough to\nmake a snail race seem akin to the Daytona 500.\n\nAfter nearly flunking out my freshman year, my parents were undoubtedly\nconcerned about my future. They could tell that I was not passionate about my\nchoice of study and they encouraged me to reconsider choosing “art” as a\ncareer. My mom brought home a book to help me think things through, titled _Do\nWhat You Love, the Money Will Follow: Discovering Your Right Livelihood_ , by\nMarsha Sinetar. I never read it. I still haven’t. But the genius title was\nenough to change the course of my life. I decided to pursue my degree in\ngraphic design. I honestly thought that one day I would be able to grow into a\ncreative director role and have a maximum salary of $45 to $50K. I figured I\nwould just have to swallow my pride as I watched my business school friends\ngraduate from college with salaries twice that size, and I took solace in the\nknowledge that at least I would be doing something I loved for a living.\n\n![Image](../images/00107.jpeg)\n\nIt did not take long for me to learn that it makes absolutely no difference\nwhat career path you choose—you can make plenty of money in your career if you\nare truly passionate about it. If you really love what you do, you will work\nhard at it. It won’t seem like work. Educating yourself on your chosen\nprofession will be a lifelong commitment. Your passion will drive you to grow\nin your abilities. It is this passion that will drive you toward hard work and\npersistence, and the combination of those things will lead you to success.",

If you really love what you do, you will work\nhard at it. It won’t seem like work. Educating yourself on your chosen\nprofession will be a lifelong commitment. Your passion will drive you to grow\nin your abilities. It is this passion that will drive you toward hard work and\npersistence, and the combination of those things will lead you to success. The\nlove you have for your career will empower you to become the very best at\nwhatever it is you are doing, and chances are that if you are the very best at\nit, someone will likely want to pay you big bucks to do it. I know of some\nvery wealthy scrapbookers, dancers, and musicians who stayed true to\nthemselves and followed their dreams.\n\nOne of the beautiful things about proceeding through life in this manner is\nthat if you really love what you do for a living, the money thing matters so\nmuch less. Who cares how much money you make if you get to go to a job that\npays you to be doing something you would be doing for free? This is how I view\nmy career in graphic design. I love it. I work hard at it. I have been\npersistent. I have been on a never-ending quest of self-education, and—in the\nend—the money did follow. As my skills grew, I garnered new job offers. As I\ncontributed to the success of companies I worked for, I got raises. By the\ntime I was 28 years old, I was a creative director at Fox with a windowed\noffice overlooking Beverly Hills and I was drawing a salary three times the\nsize of what I thought would be my maximum after decades of work. I started my\nown business at age 30, a roller coaster ride that has definitely been filled\nwith more ups than downs, and with notable clients I only dreamed I could\nserve.\n\nIronically, after shunning the pursuit of a degree in business to follow my\nheart and choose a creative career, I now find myself in a businessman’s chair\nin love with my profession. I admit there were times during the transition\nfrom designer to creative director to business owner where I lamented having\nlost the opportunity to manhandle Photoshop day in and day out. I felt like I\nhad promoted myself right out of a career I loved and into a role I had\nstrived to avoid. And then came the epiphany: “I may not create websites and\nlogos anymore. But I still create. Now I am creating a business, a culture, a\nbrand.” This thought has driven me to invest my creative energy into something\nnew. And the love I once had for design has been fully transferred to a love\nfor creating a business. And, as the phrase goes, the money has followed me\nthere, too.\n\nI certainly can’t promise the same results to everyone reading this. I realize\nthat I have been very fortunate in my circumstances. Choosing a career path\nthat I love has made all the difference in my life. Money could never replace\nthe joy of making a living doing something that seems like the hobby you\nalways dreamed of doing.\n\n* * *\n\nMONEY COULD NEVER REPLACE\n\nTHE JOY OF MAKING\n\nA LIVING DOING SOMETHING\n\nTHAT SEEMS LIKE THE HOBBY\n\nYOU ALWAYS DREAMED\n\nOF DOING.\n\n* * *",

A Business That Looks Orderly\n\n_“A business that looks orderly says to your customer that your people know\nwhat they’re doing. A business that looks orderly says to your people that you\nknow what you’re doing. A business that looks orderly says that while the\nworld may not work, some things can. A business that looks orderly says to\nyour customer that he can trust in the result delivered and assures your\npeople that they can trust in their future with you. A business that looks\norderly says that the structure is in place.”_\n\n—The E-Myth Revisited, _1995, 103_\n\nThe _E-Myth Revisited_ is one of the few paradigm-shift business books out\nthere, as there are more than a few phrases in the book that have the capacity\nto be life-changing, some of which have had a huge impact on my career.\n\nI had just hired my first few employees and I was making adjustments to how\nthey operated versus how I operated. One employee liked doing things one way,\nwhile I liked doing them another. After reading a part of _The E-Myth\nRevisited_ that spoke of the merits of an orderly business and its impression\non potential clients, I realized that what I had was not an orderly\nbusiness—it was a room full of freelancers, and our clients could sense it. I\nstarted right then to try to present a unified message to our clients, with\nthe goal being a consistent, methodical way of operating our company.\n\nI created a little internal website that documented our “orderly standards.”\nIt included everything from how to answer the phone to how to deliver a\nproject. The internal site became “the law” for everyone to follow. As a\nresult, our clients from that day on have had a consistent experience with our\ncompany. Whether working directly with me or with the person we hired last\nweek, their experience will be the same.\n\nTHE E-MYTH REVISITED by MICHAEL E. GERBER. Copyright (c) 1995, 2001 by Michael\nE. Gerber. Reprinted by permission of HarperCollins Publishers.\n\nEven if you are still a one-person show, it is vital to your future success\nthat you set up your methods and “best practices” now, so that in the heat of\nthe moment when business is booming and you are in deep, you have a system in\nplace to carry you through and show your clients that at face value—even\nthough you may be like a duck’s feet below the surface—you have it all under\ncontrol. This will allow them to have confidence in you no matter what. It\nwill also give you confidence in yourself; if you repeatedly carry out your\nday-to-day business in a way that is precise and orderly, you will soon find\nthat you can take comfort in those consistencies, even on the days when your\nlife and your work feel like a stormy sea at best.\n\n![Image](../images/00108.jpeg)\n\n\n## 81\\.

Making Cents of It All\n\nWith over 1,500 projects under my belt as a freelancer and business owner,\nsaying that I’ve experimented with pricing structures may be the\nunderstatement of the year. In my early years, nearly everything was based on\na fixed bid. As my client list grew, I began landing some hourly gigs,\nretainers, and some dedicated resource structures.

Understanding these pricing structures, explaining them clearly to\nyour clients, and choosing the right one for the job can make the difference\nbetween a blissful client experience and your worst nightmare.\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00109.jpeg) **Fixed Bid**\n\nFixed-bid pricing is a set scope of work with a fixed price. You tell the\nclient exactly what you are going to do and exactly what it is going to cost.\nAs long as the client stays within the scope of the project, they are charged\nthe price you quoted. In my experience, fixed-bid pricing is the option most\ncommonly used in the graphic design industry.\n\n**_Pros for you:_**\n\nYou know exactly what you are going to make on the project. If the job takes\nyou less time than you expected, you make more profit.\n\n**_Cons for you:_**\n\nSince you are locked into a price, if the job takes you more time than\nexpected, you make less profit (you could even lose money).\n\n**_Pros for the client:_**\n\nThe client knows exactly what they are going to have to pay, assuming they\nstay within the project scope. They can reasonably assume that they will be\nable to stay within their allocated budget for the project.\n\n**_Cons for the client:_**\n\nDue to the tricky nature of fixed-bid pricing, you as the design agency will\noften need to pad your estimate to account for any unforeseen challenges in\nthe project. As a result, the client could end up paying a lot more for a\nproject than if it were priced in a different structure. Additionally, if the\nclient goes out of the scope to a degree that requires you to send them change\norders, they can become frustrated and feel like you are nickel-and-diming\nthem.\n\n**_Things to watch out for:_**\n\nWith fixed-bid pricing, you must clearly define the scope of the project. If\nyou don’t have every little detail (deliverables, functionality, design\nrounds, change rounds, and so on) defined in your proposal, there is a high\nlikelihood that you will eventually get stung by a fixed-bid project.\n\nYou must try to help the client adhere to the defined project scope.\nUnfortunately, no matter what you do to clearly detail the project, there is a\nchance that the client will come up with something they want you to do that\nwas not included in your scope. Keeping them “in scope” can be a challenging\nclient management task.\n\n**_When to use it:_**\n\nFixed-bid structures are best used when the client knows exactly what they\nwant you to produce and exactly what they are comfortable spending.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00110.jpeg) **Hourly**\n\nYou and your client agree on an hourly rate. You track your hours and bill\nyour client in regularly agreed-upon intervals (such as weekly or monthly).\n\n**_Pros for you:_**\n\nFor every hour you spend on a project, you have something to bill for. This\nstructure eliminates the risk of losing money on a project.\n\n**_Cons for you:_**\n\n“Value pricing” doesn’t come into play here. If you design a logo in one hour,\nyou are locked into charging your client the agreed-upon hourly rate even\nthough the “value” of the logo to the client far exceeded what they paid for\nit.\n\n**_Pros for the client:_**\n\nThe client does not need a clearly defined project scope to begin working with\nyou. They have the flexibility to change their mind on things and add new\nitems to your plate.\n\n**_Cons for the client:_**\n\nIt can be difficult for the client to know how much they should budget for\nyour services if they pay by the hour.\n\n**_Things to watch out for:_**\n\nTo help keep your client relationship healthy, it is recommended that you\nregularly communicate how many hours you are spending for the client’s\nprojects. Also, for each request they make, tell them roughly how many hours\nit will take. Nobody likes to be surprised by a giant bill.",

Also, for each request they make, tell them roughly how many hours\nit will take. Nobody likes to be surprised by a giant bill.\n\n**_When to use it:_**\n\nHourly structures are best used in maintenance situations. Perhaps you have\nfinished a website project and the client would like you to make occasional\nsite updates. Or, you did a stationery package and the client would like you\nto create business cards for a new employee.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00111.jpeg) **Retainer**\n\nRetainers are also based on hours spent on a project. Typically, you give the\nclient a discounted rate for guaranteeing you hours (usually by month). For\nexample, if your standard rate is $100 per hour and you are pitching your\nclient a retainer structure, you could discount the rate based on the number\nof hours they retain. (If the client retains 20 to 40 hours per month they pay\n$90 per hour, 41 to 60 hours per month they pay $80 per hour, 61 to 80 hours\nper month they pay $70 per hour, and so on.) Retainers are purchasing a bucket\nof hours to be used for the client’s requests. Those hours are usually spread\nacross whatever team members are necessary to complete the request.\n\n**_Pros for you:_**\n\nYou get guaranteed monthly billings. This can give you cash flow and the\nconfidence to allow you to hire new employees or expand your business in other\nways against the retainer.\n\n**_Cons for you:_**\n\nBy reducing your rate based on hours retained, you are also reducing your\nprofit margin. Also, as with the previously mentioned hourly pricing\nstructure, “value pricing” does not apply.\n\n**_Pros for the client:_**\n\nBy paying a reduced rate for guaranteed hours, the client gets more work for\nless money.\n\n**_Cons client:_**\n\nIn this pricing structure, the client has a responsibility to fill the\nretained hours or they lose them. If they retain 40 hours per month and use\nonly 38 hours, they still pay for the 40 hours.\n\n**_Things to watch out for:_**\n\nSince the client is retaining hours, you must be extremely attentive to their\nneeds until the hours are used up. It is also important to keep an accurate\naccounting of the hours for proper billing.\n\nOftentimes, a client will have a challenge understanding that they are\npurchasing a block of hours from you, and that whether they use them or not,\nyou have made arrangements in your business to have those hours available for\nthem. If the client uses more hours than the agreed-upon retainer, they should\npay for the extra hours. We typically charge their retained rate plus 10\npercent for all extra hours beyond the retainer. (For example, if the client\nis retaining 80 hours per month and they use 90 hours, they pay $70 per hour\nfor the first 80 hours and then $77 per hour for the extra 10 hours.) The\nreason for the increased cost attached to extra hours is to accommodate for\nthe unanticipated and unscheduled workload.\n\n**_When to use it:_**\n\nRetainers work best when the client knows that they have an ample amount of\nprojects that they will need you to complete over a set amount of time but\nthey are still unclear of the details.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n![Image](../images/00112.jpeg) **Dedicated Resources**\n\nSlightly different from retainers, the dedicated resource structure allocates\ncertain employees to a client for a certain period of time. Retainer\nstructures buy hours. Dedicated resource structures buy people.",

Retainer\nstructures buy hours. Dedicated resource structures buy people. This structure\nis usually calculated in “man weeks.” You work with the client to determine\nhow long you expect the project to take and dedicate specific employees to the\ntask. The more “man weeks” the client buys, the lower the rate they pay. (For\nexample, if the agreement dedicates an employee for 4 to 6 “man weeks” they\npay $5,000 per week, for 7 to 10 weeks they pay $4,500 per week, for 11 to 14\nweeks they pay $4,000 per week, and so on.)\n\n**_Pros for you:_**\n\nLike retainers, this structure can give you the cash flow and confidence to\nexpand your business.\n\n**_Cons for you:_**\n\nAlso like retainers, you are charging a reduced rate, which reduces your\nprofit margin. You also may need to dedicate some of your top performers to a\nclient, thus losing their involvement on other projects.\n\n**_Pros for the client:_**\n\nThe client pays less money for more work and can build a strong working\nrelationship with your team members as they collaborate closely on the\nproject.\n\n**_Cons for the client:_**\n\nFor the set term of the agreement, essentially it is as if the client is\nemploying your team members directly. They have a responsibility to keep them\nbusy and get the most of the relationship.\n\n**_Things to watch out for:_**\n\nBe sure that you put a legal clause in your agreement with the client that\nthey will not hire away your employee(s). As they build a solid working\nrelationship with your team members, this becomes a risk.\n\n**_When to use it:_**\n\nThis structure works best for long-term engagements where the scope and\nfeature set of the project is difficult to determine at the start. It is most\noften seen in software development, and sometimes it will require your\nemployees to work in the offices of your client.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nUNDERSTANDING THESE\n\nPRICING STRUCTURES,\n\nEXPLAINING THEM CLEARLY\n\nTO YOUR CLIENTS,\n\nAND CHOOSING THE RIGHT ONE\n\nFOR THE JOB CAN MAKE THE\n\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN\n\nA BLISSFUL CLIENT EXPERIENCE\n\nAND YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 82\\. How to Calculate a Burn Rate\n\nHow can you know how much to charge if you don’t know how much you cost? I\nspent a lot of years pulling prices out of thin air. I had no idea what I\nshould be charging, and to be honest, I was willing to work for whatever\nsomeone would pay. As my company began to grow, I quickly learned the\nimportance of understanding costs. Knowing your costs can help you massage\nyour pricing and land new clients. It can also help you know how much time to\nallocate to each project.\n\nI certainly don’t claim to be an accountant, and my accountant may read this\nand think I’m off my rocker.

You decide that you should\nbe earning $60,000 per year for your salary. Your utilities (Internet\nconnection, electricity, cell phone, etc.) cost you roughly $300 per month (or\n$3,600 per year).

We use 2,080 hours as our number. Now, assuming you are self-\nemployed, don’t forget that it takes administrative time to run your business\n(you can’t bill a client directly for balancing your checkbook or attending an\nAIGA meeting). Let’s say you spend 10 percent of your time doing\n“nonproduction” tasks to keep your business running. That leaves you with\n1,872 production hours per year that you can bill for if the project pipeline\nis full. Now you have your numbers. Run them through the formula to figure out\nwhat you must charge per hour to “break even.”\n\n_$72,100 ÷ 1,872 = $38.51_\n\nYour hourly burn rate is $38.51. Now you can safely set a rate for your\nclients and understand where your wiggle room is. But you cannot go below\n$38.51 per hour without losing money (or paying yourself less than your\ndesired salary of $60,000). You also can make a judgment call on what you want\nto spend your time doing. I got really crazy at one point and started\nthinking, “If it takes me three hours to mow my lawn, that will cost me\n$115.53!

The Fixed-Bid Pricing Dartboard\n\nTrying to figure out how to price your work fairly can be a daunting task. In\nmy experience, most clients prefer working with fixed-bid pricing; they take\ncomfort in knowing exactly what they are going to get for exactly what price.\nOn the designer side, there is comfort in knowing exactly what you are going\nto charge for the scope of work. Fixed-bid pricing presents several\nchallenges, not the least of which is the fact that you have to base your\nprice on something. When I first started freelancing, that “something” was\noften hours. I decided to charge around $60 per hour for my time, and then I\nwould ballpark my hours and send an estimate to my client. The problem with\nthis was that I am a very fast designer and production artist. So by charging\nbased on hours, I was charging too little for most of the work I was\nproducing. That left me in a situation where I either needed to up my hourly\nrate or figure out a new way to price things.\n\n![Image](../images/00114.jpeg)\n\nI began trying to price things based on the deliverables. My estimates would\ninclude itemized pricing for each of the elements being produced. Take a\nwebsite for example. I would charge $500 for a home page and $150 for each\nsubpage. Then I’d add up all the pages and come up with a price. It didn’t\ntake me too long to learn (the hard way) that this strategy was riddled with\nproblems (see the chapter “[Beware of Line-Item\nPricing](part0095.html#ch084),” in this section, for more details).\n\nAfter experimenting with other strategies, I realized that there is no perfect\nscience to estimating your work. It frequently seems as if you are throwing a\ndart at a board and seeing where it lands. In some ways this is true. With\nfixed-bid pricing, you are often throwing out a dart and hoping you land on\nthe board in a quadrant that will generate a profit. While there is no perfect\nmethod to estimating your work, there is a strategy to making sure you are\nthrowing your dart toward the right area of the board.\n\n![Image](../images/00115.jpeg)\n\nFixed-bid pricing is a careful balance between three components: cost, value,\nand budget. Let’s examine each one.\n\n**Cost:** The first component that must be considered when estimating your\nwork is cost. You must know what your time to create the project will cost.",

Let’s examine each one.\n\n**Cost:** The first component that must be considered when estimating your\nwork is cost. You must know what your time to create the project will cost.\nThis can be done by either determining a fair hourly rate and adding up the\nnumber of hours you expect the project to take, or by figuring out your exact\nhourly cost (divide your annual overhead by your quantity of production hours\navailable in the year) and then adding a profit margin percentage on top.\n\n**Value:** The second element for consideration is the fair market value of\nthe project. Just because you can nail a logo design in one hour doesn’t mean\nyou should charge the client only $60. There is a value to the logo that far\noutweighs $60. Every designer should have the book _Graphic Artists Guild\nHandbook: Pricing & Ethical Guidelines_, by the Graphic Artists Guild. A new\nissue of the book comes out every few years, and it contains categorized\npricing for each type of graphic design service based on survey averages from\ndesign professionals nationwide. This is a great place to get an idea of what\nfair market value is for design work. Please keep in mind when reviewing the\nsurvey averages that the size and expertise of the design professionals is not\nreflected in the pricing. If the survey says a brochure for a medium-size\nbusiness should cost $8,000 and you are a wet-behind-the-ears college\ngraduate, don’t expect to be able to green light a brochure at that price. The\nobjective is to gain a sense of what other people, similar to you, charge for\nthe same types of projects you are trying to land.\n\n**Budget:** Finally, you must have a sense of what the client’s budget is for\nthe project. If you wrongly assume the budget is high, then you may send an\nestimate that prices you out of getting the project (when you would have been\nhappy charging less and landing the work). If you wrongly assume the budget is\nlow, then you may undercharge for the work and not be able to turn a profit on\nthe project. (For help with figuring out a client’s budget, see the chapter\n“[How to Flush Out a Budget](part0097.html#ch086),” in this section of the\nbook.)\n\n![Image](../images/00116.jpeg)\n\nNow you that have these three components for consideration, it is time for the\nbalancing act. Let’s throw a few darts at the board.\n\n**A client wants you to complete “Project X.”**\n\nYou expect the project will take you 10 hours at your hourly rate of $60 =\n$600.\n\nYou determine that the project has a fair market value of $2,000 based on\nindustry averages.\n\nAnd you know that the client has a budget of $1,000 to complete the work.\n\nA simple approach would be to average these three elements and send your\nclient the estimate ($600 + $2,000 + $1,000 = $3,600 ÷ 3 = $1,200).\n\nUnfortunately it is not always as simple as just averaging out the numbers\nbased on the variables. There are times when you must skew toward one of the\nthree components.\n\n**A client wants you to complete “Project Y.”**\n\nYou expect the project will take you 100 hours at your hourly rate of $60 =\n$6,000.\n\nYou determine that the project has a fair market value of $15,000 based on\nindustry averages.\n\nAnd you know that the client has a budget of $7,000 to complete the work.\n\nIn this case, if you want to land the work, you must steer your estimate\ntoward the client’s budget. My recommendation would be to balance it somewhere\nin between your hourly cost and the client’s budget, say $6,750 or so.",

Then,\ndepending on your relationship comfort level, you could let the client know\nthat you did some market research and found that this type of project is\ncosting less than what they had budgeted, and you didn’t feel it would be fair\nto charge them their full budgeted amount. This type of thing usually goes\nover very well and could be a great way to start off a project.\n\n![Image](../images/00117.jpeg)\n\nIn the end, there certainly seems to be a dartboard involved in fixed-bid\npricing. Use your best judgment on which component you should skew your price\ntoward. The better you understand the project, your client, and their\nexpectations, the easier this will be.\n\n\n## 84\\. Beware of Line-Item Pricing\n\nMost clients will be drawn to fixed-bid pricing. They want to know exactly\nwhat the project is going to cost and they expect you to stay on budget. From\nthe designer’s side, fixed-bid pricing isn’t altogether bad, since you will\nknow exactly how much you are going to make on the project.\n\nWhen I first started freelancing, I worked exclusively via fixed-bid pricing\nscales. A client would send me the specs for a project, and I would attach\npricing to the project and gain the client’s approval for that amount. I would\nbe meticulous in this, breaking down each item the project would entail in\nminute detail.\n\nFirst, I would figure out how long the whole job would take, and then I would\nbreak it out into itemized pricing. For example, if a client wants a logo\ndesign along with a stationery package, I would estimate that I would need\nabout two days of production to complete the whole project. So let’s say that\nI attach a cost of $2,000 to the project. Then, in order to help the client\nget an idea of where the costs lie, I would spread out the $2,000 across all\nthe elements of the project.\n\n**Option A**\n\nLogo Design = $800\n\nBusiness Card Design = $400\n\nLetterhead Design = $400\n\nEnvelope Design = $400\n\nTotal = $2,000\n\nEach of these items would be explained in the proposal so the client knew\nexactly what they were getting for each element. I felt cool. This line-item\npricing looked legit and organized. Look at me! I’m a graphic designer sending\nout fancy bids.\n\nWARNING: BEWARE OF ESTIMATING THINGS THIS WAY!\n\nI’ve been burned more times than I’d like to admit by this pricing strategy.\nThe client will look at this breakdown and decide that they can live without\nthe letterhead and envelopes and then ask to pull those elements from the\nproject, leaving me with $1,200 to do a job that is probably still worth\ncloser to the $2,000 mark than the $1,200 I will now be making.\n\nThe realities of this project is that most of the design work is done in the\n“Logo Design” phase. You put the brain power into this part, and as you are\ndesigning the logos you are making mental considerations for how the designs\nwill convert into the other stationery elements.",

You put the brain power into this part, and as you are\ndesigning the logos you are making mental considerations for how the designs\nwill convert into the other stationery elements. Also, once you design the\nbusiness cards, the letterhead and envelope will be a piece of cake. The truth\nof the matter is that the cost breakdown for this project would be something\ncloser to this.\n\n**Option B**\n\nLogo Design = $1,600\n\nBusiness Card Design = $200\n\nLetterhead Design = $100\n\nEnvelope Design = $100\n\nTotal = $2,000\n\nHowever, with this line-item pricing the client will look at it and possibly\nbalk at the $1,600 logo price. Most small businesses would rather have their\ncousin’s friend’s brother design their logo on trade for a new pair of\nsneakers than pay $1,600 for their logo design. So, you shouldn’t send line-\nitem pricing this way, either.\n\nIn the end, sending the client one lump-sum price like Option C is better than\nthe previous options, but this isn’t a great solution either, since breaking\nout the costs helps the client swallow a big bill easier (kind of like when\nyou go to get your car fixed at an auto repair shop).\n\n**Option C**\n\nLogo, Business Card, Letterhead, and Envelope Design = $2,000\n\nTotal = $2,000\n\n![Image](../images/00118.jpeg)\n\nSo what is a designer to do? You will need to break out pricing more in line\nwith the realities of the project. Detail out exactly what the client is going\nto get (deliverables) and then break down the pricing in this fashion.\n\n**Option D**\n\nProject Management = $300\n\nDesign = $1,000\n\nProduction = $700\n\nTotal = $2,000\n\n“Project Management” includes deliveries, phone calls, and administrative\nelements required to execute on the project. “Design” covers the creative\ntasks required to succeed on the project. And “Production” is for creation of\npress-ready files. With this strategy, the pricing is itemized so that the\nclient can understand how you arrived at the total price. But none of the\nitemized elements can be removed from the project (as they could in Option A)\nwithout requiring you to send a revised estimate to the client.\n\nThere will be times when a client will force you to break down a project as in\nOption A; they want to know exactly what each item will cost. If you must do\nso to win the job, then you must. Be careful when breaking down the price, and\nask yourself these critical questions when you look at your numbers: “If the\nclient pulls out any one item of this cost breakdown, will I still be happy\nwith the total price of the job? If they pull an item, will I still be able to\nexecute on the other elements at the individual prices they are quoted?” If\nyou answer no to either question, then rework the numbers until you are\nsatisfied. When a client forces you into itemizing a project, then you have to\nassume that they are considering pulling out elements. Brace yourself and\ntread lightly.\n\nIf you are forced into an Option A type of estimate and are satisfied with\nyour itemized prices, be sure to cover yourself by mentioning that your\npricing takes into consideration economies of scale. For more information\nabout that, please refer to the chapter “[Twenty-Piece Chicken\nMcNuggets](part0098.html#ch087),” in this section of the book.\n\n\n## 85\\. “No Charge” Doesn’t Mean “Free”\n\nAt the end of 2009, my company green lit our biggest single-dollar project\never.

Eight long months later, we were dealing with the biggest project\ndisaster in our company’s history. We worked with the client through changing\nscope and shifting ideas, rolling with the punches all along. After receiving\nthe green light, we submitted changes and restarted the project three times.\nEach of these times required us to rewrite the proposal, and resulted in us\nmaking the decision to eat the work we had completed on previously green-lit\nelements that were no longer part of the client’s strategy moving forward.\n\nFinally, the client requested the fourth change in scope, this time attempting\nto cut the project in half based on a new investor who was planning to\ncomplete some of the elements themselves. In a heated and uncomfortable phone\ncall with the client, we told them that their newly-proposed budget for\nproposal #4, which was 50 percent of the original budget, did not leave us\nroom to absorb the cost related to items previously green lit in proposals #1,\n#2, and #3 that were now cancelled. The client said, “We don’t see any listing\nof the costs of those items in proposals #2 or #3.” They were right. We had\ndecided to eat those changes for the good of the relationship with the client,\nbut we never documented it to make them aware. We were doing a good deed for\nour relationship and they had no idea we were doing them any favors; we were\nreceiving absolutely nothing for our generosity.\n\nMost of us have heard the phrase, “Nothing in life is free.” I did a little\nresearch and couldn’t find the origin of this phrase, but I spent a great deal\nof time pondering its meaning. In graphic design, you may do a lot of work for\n“no charge,” but that does not mean it is “free.” You give away your time and\nenergy at “no charge” in hopeful expectation of some reward from your client,\nsuch as an improved relationship, future favors, referrals, and additional\nprojects, to name just a few.\n\nIn order to make sure your client is aware of your generous gifts of time, you\nmust document all of the work you complete for the client whether you charge\nthem for it or not. This strategy can be accomplished easily in your proposals\nand invoices. Perhaps an example will help illustrate this point.\n\nA client comes to you requesting a logo design. You send a simple proposal to\ncreate a logo for them at a price of $500. During the design process, you\ndecide to create a business card design to show off how cool the logo is to\nthe client. The client is awed by your killer design skills and asks you to\ncomplete press-ready files for the business cards. Since the design is already\ncomplete, you decide to throw it in for “free.” In order to make sure your\nclient is aware of your generosity, you could add a line to your invoice like\nthis:\n\nLogo Design = $500\n\nBusiness Card Design ($300 value) = No Charge\n\nTotal Amount Due = $500\n\nIf you hadn’t highlighted this to your client, you would be less likely to be\ncompensated in nonfinancial ways for your good will.\n\nWe recently had a client re-sign a retainer agreement with us. Their three-\nmonth-long retainer bought 80 hours per month of design and production at a\nprice of $8,000 per month. However, due to budget constraints heading into\ntheir year-end, they asked to reduce the retainer hours by 10 percent. As a\ngesture of kindness toward the client, we decided to keep their monthly hours\nthe same and just discount our rate. They were grateful for our generosity.\nBut we failed to document our generosity when we sent them the new proposal.\n\n!",

How to Flush Out a Budget\n\nProposals can take a lot of time to create, and if you don’t land the project\nyou will never be reimbursed for that time and effort. Asking a client for a\nbudget is sometimes risky; they may think that if they tell you their budget,\nyou will just charge them that price whether the project should cost that much\nor not. (And in some cases they may be right.)\n\nThe problem is that if you don’t have a price range from the client, you are\nbidding blind. You don’t know if they want to buy a gourmet meal or a fast-\nfood hamburger. Many people don’t have any idea of the time and cost of\ngraphic design. They may be thinking that the website they want to create will\ncost around $1,000 when in reality their request will cost $10,000.\n\nHere are a few techniques to help you flush out a budget before you go to the\ncostly lengths of creating a full-blown, formal proposal.\n\n**The Direct Approach**\n\n“OK, John, I think I have all of the specifications for the project. Is there\na budget number you are shooting for?”\n\n**Chuck a Range**\n\n“Similar past projects that we have done have cost between $5,000 and $10,000.\nWhere does your budget fit in that price range?”\n\n**Compare Another Product**\n\n“We always like to ask about our client’s budget to know what features we\nshould pack into the proposal. A Hyundai and a Ferrari will both get you from\npoint A to point B. Are you wanting something really high-end for your\nproject? Or are you shopping for a base model to get things rolling, with the\nplan to add features later?”\n\n![Image](../images/00120.jpeg)\n\n**Give a Past Project Example**\n\n“I’m not sure where we’ll end up price-wise in the proposal because I need to\ntalk to my design team to find out how long they think things will take. But I\ncan tell you that our last project like this came to around $5,000. Is that a\nrough price range you would be comfortable with?”\n\n**Project Quick Sheet**\n\nIf you are concerned that the client doesn’t have sufficient budget to do the\nproject, try sending them a Project Quick Sheet before you create a big\nmultipage formal proposal. The Project Quick Sheet is a simple one-page\nestimate that includes:\n\n**_Project Summary_** (a few sentences describing the project)\n\n**_Timeline Estimate_** (approximately how long it will take to complete the\nproject)\n\n**_Cost Estimate_** (estimated pricing for the project)\n\nWhen you send this to the client, you should include a line like this in your\nemail:\n\n_“Before detailing the full scope of the project, we wanted to send you a\nrough estimate to make sure we’re on the same page. The attached Project Quick\nSheet provides a project summary, timeline, and cost for the project as we\nunderstand it. Please let us know if these three items seem in line with your\nthoughts and we’ll get to work on the full-blown proposal that details out the\nentire project. Thanks!”_\n\nThese techniques do a great job of either scaring away a client who has no\nbudget or bolstering your confidence in the bid process by knowing your\nclient’s budget range.\n\n\n## 87\\.

But I assure you it was not because I don’t understand economics.\nIt was simply because I was spending way more time goofing around than I spent\ngoing to class. In order to earn my D, I really learned only two things. The\nfirst was “The Law of Diminishing Returns” (in layman’s terms, you are more\nproductive during hour one of the work day compared to hour 20, or the first\npiece of cheesecake is more satisfying than the 10th piece of cheesecake when\neaten in one sitting). The second thing I learned was “Economies of Scale.”\nLet’s take a minute to discuss the second.\n\nEconomies of scale basically means that unit costs of a product or service go\ndown as volume goes up, as in mass production (that is, the bigger the\nproject, the lower the associated cost per unit).\n\nHere are a few examples of how economies of scale play out in the graphic\ndesign industry.\n\nA client approaches you to design a website for their business. You conduct an\nanalysis of their needs and expect the site to be 10 pages. You determine that\nthe price for their 10-page website will be $10,000, accounting for 100 hours\nof work.\n\nAnother client approaches you to design their website, and after a needs\nanalysis you find that their site will require 15 pages (50 percent larger\nthan the 10-page site). After you crunch the numbers with your team, you find\nthat the 15-page site will really take only 10 hours longer than the 10-page\nsite, so you send an estimate for $11,000 (only 10 percent more than the\n10-page site).\n\nThis is economies of scale in action. Each site requires initial design work\nto create the overall look and feel. By the time three to five pages are fully\nprogrammed, the programmers have enough code to reuse, thus allowing the\nadditional five pages to take very little time to complete. In fact, the\ninitial design and programming is so labor intensive that a 3- to 5-page\nwebsite may cost only slightly less than a 10-page website (depending on the\ncomplexity of the design).\n\nAs another example of economies of scale, maybe you are designing a series of\nmagazine ads. To create the initial concept for the first ad, it may require\n80 percent of the creative brain power and design time for the whole project.\nThus the additional ads in the series require only a fraction of the time\nnecessary to create the original ad.\n\nAs a further example on press, the per-unit print pricing goes down when the\nvolume goes up. For example, a 10,000-piece press run may cost $1.00 per unit\n($10,000), and a 1,000-piece press run may cost $10.00 per unit ($10,000).\nThis is due to the labor and set-up time that goes into each project, large or\nsmall, as well as the cost of materials going down with volume increase.\n\nEven fast food chains offer economies of scale! When you buy a combo meal,\nyour drink and fries price-per-unit goes down due to discounts based on\nvolume. My favorite example of economies of scale is found in Chicken\nMcNuggets. While a 10-piece Chicken McNuggets costs $3.99 (or 39¢ per Nugget),\nthe 20-piece version is just $4.99. That comes out to only 25¢ per Nugget!\nEconomies of scale can be found everywhere.\n\nMy company once had a squirrelly client who kept trying to cut the price on\ntheir project. (Actually, we’ve had many squirrelly clients for that matter.)\nWe sent our original proposal to the client and they requested that we break\nout all our pricing into line items. We accommodated their request, after\nwhich they began cutting items off of the list based on their line-item price.\nIn the end, the scope of work was cut down to fit their budget and we were\nleft with several minimally profitable pieces. After we developed the initial\nelements they began to cut down the project again. What started as a $200,000\nbudget was cut to $100,000 and then cut to $50,000.",

Nonprofits for Non-Profit\n\nThere is no shortage of people in the world who think you should do graphic\ndesign work for free. After all, it is only time that is being spent to design\nthings, and you are having fun while you do it. It doesn’t really “cost”\nanything, right?\n\nMost designers have pro bono work going on nearly all the time. There is\nalways their brother’s logo or their uncle’s website under heavy construction.\nEach of those pro bono jobs seems to lead to referrals for more pro bono jobs.\nI certainly have done my share of free design work, and my company seems to\nhave a steady stream of charitable organizations requesting our services.\n\nMany charitable organizations run on very tight budgets. Typically the head of\nthese organizations is a master at asking for favors and receiving them. Be\naware that one favor usually leads to two. Two favors usually leads to three.\nAnd before you know it, you are swallowed up doing a ton of free work to\nsupport their organization. Most of these charitable organizations provide\nadmirable services and are worth the consideration of your generous support.\nHowever, you have a right to provide those services under your terms. Here are\na few ways to consider working with charities.\n\n**Service**\n\nIf you believe in the organization and have the time, providing free graphic\ndesign services may be right up your alley. Go for it!\n\n**Portfolio Boost**\n\nIt may be worth your time to provide graphic design services for free if the\nproject will be a great enhancement to your portfolio. Sometimes free design\nwork empowers you to be more creative and more easily control the flow of the\nproject.\n\n**One at a Time**\n\nI’ve heard of agencies that limit their charitable client list to a maximum of\none or two. This empowers you to easily say “no” when you are being cornered\nby another charitable organization.\n\n**Set Scope of Work**\n\nWith any project, paid or unpaid, it is critical to clearly define the scope\nof work. However, with charity work this becomes even more important. You\nshould still create a proposal whether the project has payment or not. In the\nproposal you must clearly define what work you will be doing for free and what\nwork will require payment. For example, if you agree to design and build a\ncharity’s website for free but want to keep from being abused in the future,\nbe sure to clarify that all changes requested after launch of the site will be\nbilled at $X per hour. You don’t have to do everything for free.\n\n**Nonprofits for Non-Profit**\n\nOne of my agency’s most valued clients is a nonprofit organization that is\noperated by a multibillionaire. They have been our client for many years and\nwe charge them our cost. We support their nonprofit efforts by providing\ngraphic design services at no profit to us. We have created and maintained\nseveral websites and branding initiatives for them, and we bill them by the\nhour on a monthly basis.\n\n**Nonprofit for Profit**\n\nJust because a company is a nonprofit does not mean they have no money. Some\nof the larger charities actually have giant marketing budgets. Don’t be afraid\nto treat a nonprofit like any other client. Just because their business is\nnon-profit doesn’t mean that your business has to be.\n\nI strongly encourage providing charitable design services. Charitable giving\nis part of our society, and service is at the heart of the graphic design\nprofession. Just make sure you stay seated in the captain’s chair if you are\ndoing the work for free.\n\n* * *\n\nTHERE IS NO SHORTAGE\n\nOF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD\n\nWHO THINK YOU SHOULD\n\nDO GRAPHIC DESIGN\n\nWORK FOR FREE.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 89\\.

    "chunk_full": "## 89\\. The Code of Fair Practice\n\nI worked for nearly ten years as a professional graphic designer prior to\nfinding out about the Code of Fair Practice. Maybe you already know about it\nand I’m the crazy one, but just in case, here is the ever-important\ninformation that you must understand.\n\nThe Code of Fair Practice was originally written and published by The Joint\nEthics Committee in 1948 for the graphic communications industry. It was\nrevised in 1989 and has been used by thousands of artist professionals as a\nguide to creating equitable business relationships with their clients.\nFollowing the articles of the code will help you create “win-win”\nrelationships with your clients as you both agree to engage in an ethical and\nprofessional relationship.\n\nThe word “artist” is meant to apply to any seller of “art,” including graphic\ndesign, photography, illustration, and other related professions. For our\npurposes, the word “buyer” means “client.”\n\n**The Code of Fair Practice**\n\nARTICLE 1: Negotiations between an artist or the artist’s representative and a\nclient shall be conducted only through an authorized buyer.\n\nARTICLE 2: Orders or agreements between an artist or artist’s representative\nand buyer should be in writing and shall include the specific rights which are\nbeing transferred, the specific fee arrangement agreed to by the parties,\ndelivery date, and a summarized description of the work.\n\nARTICLE 3: All changes or additions not due to the fault of the artist or\nartist’s representative should be billed to the buyer as an additional and\nseparate charge.\n\nARTICLE 4: There should be no charges to the buyer for revisions or retakes\nmade necessary by errors on the part of the artist or the artist’s\nrepresentative.\n\nARTICLE 5: If work commissioned by a buyer is postponed or canceled, a “kill-\nfee” should be negotiated based on time allotted, effort expended, and\nexpenses incurred. In addition, other lost work shall be considered.\n\nARTICLE 6: Completed work shall be promptly paid for in full and the artwork\nshall be returned promptly to the artist. Payment due the artist shall not be\ncontingent upon third-party approval or payment.\n\nARTICLE 7: Alterations shall not be made without consulting the artist. Where\nalterations or retakes are necessary, the artist shall be given the\nopportunity of making such changes.\n\nARTICLE 8: The artist shall notify the buyer of any anticipated delay in\ndelivery. Should the artist fail to keep the contract through unreasonable\ndelay or nonconformance with agreed specifications, it will be considered a\nbreach of contract by the artist. Should the agreed timetable be delayed due\nto the buyer’s failure, the artist should endeavor to adhere as closely as\npossible to the original schedule as other commitments permit.\n\nARTICLE 9: Whenever practical, the buyer of artwork shall provide the artist\nwith samples of the reproduced artwork for self-promotion purposes.\n\nARTICLE 10: There shall be no undisclosed rebates, discounts, gifts, or\nbonuses requested by or given to buyers by the artist or representative.\n\nARTICLE 11: Artwork and copyright ownership are vested in the hands of the\nartist unless agreed to in writing. No works shall be duplicated, archived, or\nscanned without the artist’s prior authorization.\n\nARTICLE 12: Original artwork, and any material object used to store a computer\nfile containing original artwork, remains the property of the artist unless it\nis specifically purchased. It is distinct from the purchase of any\nreproduction rights.(*1) All transactions shall be in writing.\n\nARTICLE 13: In case of copyright transfers, only specified rights are\ntransferred. All unspecified rights remain vested with the artist. All\ntransactions shall be in writing.\n\nARTICLE 14: Commissioned artwork is not to be considered as “work for hire”\nunless agreed to in writing before work begins.\n\nARTICLE 15: When the price of work is based on limited use and later such work\nis used more extensively, the artist shall receive additional payment.\n\nARTICLE 16: Art or photography should not be copied for any use, including\nclient presentation or “comping,” without the artist’s prior authorization. If\nexploratory work, comprehensives, or preliminary photographs from an\nassignment are subsequently chosen for reproduction, the artist’s permission\nshall be secured and the artist shall receive fair additional payment.\n\nARTICLE 17: If exploratory work, comprehensives, or photographs are bought\nfrom an artist with the intention or possibility that another artist will be\nassigned to do the finished work, this shall be in writing at the time of\nplacing the order.",

Any agreement that is not intended to be\nexclusive should set forth the exact restrictions agreed upon between the\nparties.\n\nARTICLE 26: Severance of an association between artist and representative\nshould be agreed to in writing.

Artists and designers who accept\nspeculative assignments (whether directly from a client or by entering a\ncontest or competition) risk losing anticipated fees, expenses, and the\npotential opportunity to pursue other, rewarding assignments.

These are industry standard guidelines that have\nexisted since 1948. You didn’t invent them and neither did your attorney.\nWhile any contract can be modified in writing, and this is no different,\nbeware of any client who requests to change any of these articles. A client\nwho does not agree to abide by the Code of Fair Practice could be a potential\nnightmare in your future. If a client wants to change any of the legal terms\nof your contract, consult an attorney to ensure that the terms you agree upon\nwith your client have both parties’ interests mutually represented.\n\n\n## 90\\. Contractual Mumbo Jumbo\n\nGraphic designers as a collective breed typically dislike the legalities of\nthe business. I’m sure we all would admit that we’d prefer simply creating\nsomething really cool versus the reality of life, which sometimes consists of\nhaggling with clients over the contract points of a project. Unfortunately\nalmost every graphic designer I’ve met claims to be a “freelancer,” and as a\nresult they must have some knowledge of how to put together a contract.\n\nFor the first several years that my company was in business, our proposals\ncontained no terms and conditions. Somehow we muddled through hundreds of\nprojects without getting into any trouble. Our clients paid. We never had to\ntalk to an attorney. It all seemed too easy. Then the projects started getting\nbigger, the financials became larger, and the timelines were longer. It became\napparent that we needed to become more structured or we were going to get\nstung by a deceitful client (which inevitably did happen, more than once).\n\nHere is your first step to success: You must own a copy of _The Graphic\nArtists Guild Handbook: Pricing & Ethical Guidelines_. Purchase the latest\nedition (a new one comes out every few years). If you don’t own it, stop what\nyou are doing right now and order a copy. _The Graphic Artists Guild Handbook_\nis filled with information to help cultivate and sharpen your business savvy.\n\n![Image](../images/00122.jpeg)\n\nToward the back of each edition of the book is a section called “Standard\nContracts & Business Tools.” This section discusses in great detail the\ndifferent contract types, payment issues, negotiation approaches, and legal\nissues facing designers today. It also contains numerous contracts and forms\nfor you to use as a springboard for your own business. Read that section.\nUnless you have your own attorney and customized solutions for your contracts,\nuse those guidelines. I know it may be boring at first, but you must educate\nyourself on standard contract points so you don’t open yourself up to\npotentially getting cheated by a malicious client. They are out there, like\nFreddy Krueger, just waiting for you to fall asleep.",

It can also refer\nto extras or sundries. In other words, you can use it to avoid being specific.\nNot a great idea for your business.\n\nAny lawyer reading this will likely think, “Of course. You should never put\n“etc.” in your business documentation.” Unfortunately, most of us don’t have\nlawyers. My agency completed over 1,500 projects in our first ten years. I\njust conducted some research on past proposals and found the word “etc.”\nappeared in 80 percent of the proposals we had sent in our first five years!\n(We have since abandoned this bad habit.) Fortunately, we’ve never been stung\nby this practice.\n\nHere are a few embarrassing examples pulled from website and game proposals\nwe’ve sent to our clients:\n\n_“The page will include standard MySpace features and links (Add to Friends,\nAdd to Favorites, Forums, Comments,_ **_etc._**_).”_\n\n_“Users will be able to choose a frame, background, skin,_ **_etc._**_, for\neach of their cases.”_\n\n_“Multiple game levels each with their own theme. For example, the user can\nbegin in the Dressing Room and progress through themed levels to eventually\narrive at Center Stage—progressive levels can include: Backstage, Make-up,_\n**_etc._**_”_\n\n_“You could lose one if you run into a creepy object (spider, skull,_\n**_etc._**_) or a booby trap.”_\n\n_“The mini games & training could be graphically represented by tents, race\ntracks, carnival stands,_ **_etc._**_”_\n\nThe problem arises when it comes time to interpret exactly what “etc.” means.\nWhat if the client interprets “etc.” to mean, “Creation of video chat\ntechnology to be utilized for distribution of the website or game via mobile\ndevices?” If that is not what you meant by the word “etc.,” then you’re in\ntrouble!\n\nWhen writing proposals, the word “etcetera” should not be part of your\nvocabulary. You must clearly define in exact detail what will be a part of the\nproject expectations and how things will be created. While you’re at it, be\nsure to avoid some words and phrases such as _and_ _so on, and so forth,\nstuff, other things, additional items,_ and similar ambiguous phrases that\nwill certainly get you into trouble at some point in your relationship with a\nclient.\n\n![Image](../images/00123.jpeg)\n\n\n## 92\\. You Don’t Have to Sign Off on This\n\nMost of the freelancers and graphic design business owners whom I know are not\nformally trained in business practices. As a result, being taken advantage of\nby sneaky clients happens all too frequently. I know for certain that it has\nhappened in my company.\n\nAfter a few years of existence, our agency had an attorney write up a set of\nTerms & Conditions to be included in all of our proposals. It cost us $500 and\nwe felt like we were growing up. “Check us out! We hired a lawyer for\nsomething.”\n\nMost of our prospective clients said nothing about these new additions to our\nproposals, and we were glad they were there “just in case” something got ugly\nwith a project. We felt protected by our fancy Terms & Conditions.\n\nOur problem, and the problem with most small agencies and freelancers, is that\nwe would agree to throw out our Terms & Conditions anytime a prospective\nclient asked us to. We felt like we had to agree to the terms that our client\nwanted to have in place in order to gain the green light on the project. We\nwere hungry for the work and, quite frankly, willing to do anything to land\nit—even if that meant putting ourselves legally into harm’s way.\n\nThe reality is that when a client sends you new Terms & Conditions to insert\ninto your proposal, YOU DON’T HAVE TO SIGN OFF ON IT. And you are better off\nnot signing off on your client’s sometimes lopsided terms than you would be if\nyou landed the project and set yourself up for potential trouble down the\nroad.\n\n![Image](../images/00124.jpeg)\n\nAn client once approached us with a large project.

We were really excited\nabout the project and worked hard to win it. It was a happy day when they gave\nus a verbal green light. The final hurdle was that they wanted to remove our\nTerms & Conditions and insert their own. This project was over $100,000 and\nour “junior mindset” led us to say, “No problem! Send over your terms and\nwe’ll put them into the proposal for sign-off.” When their terms came over, we\npulled out our 19 terms that filled the space of one page and inserted their\ncustom-written terms that filled three full pages of our proposal (at 9-point\ntype!).\n\n![Image](../images/00125.jpeg)\n\nMonths later, this client turned out to be a wolf in sheep’s clothing, and we\nneeded to get out of the project before it dragged down our whole office\nculture. We began to review their terms more closely and realized we were in\ntrouble by the legal language contained therein:\n\n_6) Vendor represents and warrants that:_\n\n_(i) it will perform Services in a good, workmanlike, and professional manner\nconsistent with highest industry standards and applicable laws and\nregulations;_\n\n_(ii) Services will be performed in strict compliance with the terms of this\nAgreement;_\n\n_(iii) neither the performance of Services nor the use of any Work Product, as\ndefined herein, will in any way violate or infringe upon any third party\nrights, including rights regarding ownership, trade secrets, trademarks,\ncopyright or patents; and_\n\n_(iv) it will protect, promote and preserve the goodwill associated with the\nCompany trade name and any Company customer and/or vendor relationships in\nconnection with its performance of Services and/or New Services hereunder._\n\n_7) In the event of a breach of Section 6, the Company, at its sole option and\nat the Vendor’s sole expense, can either require Vendor to re-perform the\nServices, which may include modifying the Deliverable, or generate new\nDeliverable, or refund all amounts paid under this Agreement._\n\n* * *\n\nYOU ARE BETTER OFF NOT\n\nWORKING WITH THE CLIENT\n\nTHAN SIGNING AN AGREEMENT\n\nTHAT TURNS\n\nINTO A NIGHTMARE.\n\n* * *\n\nIn layman’s terms, the above says, “If they don’t like our work they can have\nus redo it or ask for all their money back!” Why in the world would anyone\nsign off on this? (Yet we did. And many of you reading this would have signed\noff on it, too. After all, we felt like we had to go along with it in order to\nland the work). Their terms were filled with additional lopsided legal lines\nthat protected them and put us in a completely submissive position.\n\n![Image](../images/00126.jpeg)\n\nA healthy agreement protects the interests of both parties. At some point in\nyour career, a prospective client will undoubtedly present you with Terms &\nConditions that smell a little funny. When this inevitably happens, trust your\ninstinct. If it seems lopsided, it probably is lopsided. Remember, YOU DON’T\nHAVE TO SIGN OFF ON _ANYTHING_. Consult with an attorney.

B.A.M. Lists\n\nAugust 2006 was a dark month in our company history. Our work had piled up\nfaster than we were able to staff against it. Our young team of designers and\nprogrammers were tasting something at our company that we had not yet\nexperienced: brutally long work hours. The team dubbed this month “Black\nAugust.”\n\nMost successful agencies have horror stories of frantic all-nighters, racing\nto hit looming deadlines. Our agency has been in a constant battle to solve\nthis notorious problem and its associated issues: How do you staff up fast\nenough to manage spikes in the production load, and how do you reduce overhead\nwhen the spike is over?\n\nOur solution is the B.A.M. list. B.A.M. stands for “Black August Munitions.”\nIt is simply a list of freelancers categorized by their expertise. When we\ndecide that a freelancer has the skills to help our business, we ask them to\nstop by and fill out all the necessary paperwork (W-9, Confidentiality\nAgreement, and so one, congruent with their level of potential involvement\nwith our company). By having them complete the necessary paperwork in advance\nof us needing them for production, there is nothing standing in the way when\nthe time comes for us to use them.\n\nEvery time work starts piling up, we determine whether we feel it is a spike\nor if it is sustainable growth. If it is a spike, we pull out the B.A.M. list.\nWe search for the appropriate freelancer and then bring them in to help manage\nthe load.\n\n_So what does this have to do with you?_\n\nIf you are a business owner or independent freelancer, make a B.A.M. list and\ndistribute it to everyone in your company. Oftentimes, it is an employee\nburied in work who needs the reminder that there are freelance resources\navailable.\n\nIf you are a freelancer looking for work, get on the B.A.M. list of agencies\nin your area. A simple email containing the following should help get things\nrolling:\n\n_“I am emailing you today because I feel that I would be a great fit to help\nsupport your overflow work. I was curious if you had a list of freelancers\nthat you use to support your company; if so, I would love to be added to that\nlist. I’d be happy to swing by your office, briefly show you my portfolio, and\nsign a nondisclosure agreement or whatever else you would need me to do to be\nconsidered for overflow work. It seems every successful agency has times when\nthe workload gets heavy. Next time that happens for you, I would love to be\nready to pitch in.”_\n\n![Image](../images/00127.jpeg)",

    "chunk_full": "## 94\\. One Line That Changed Everything about Collections\n\nGetting paid can sometimes be a traumatic experience for a freelancer or a\nsmall business. Typically, we email invoices to our clients and they push them\nthrough their accounts payable system. If your client is a small business,\ngetting paid on time often has everything to do with whether they have money\nor not. If you are working with a big corporation, getting paid on time has\neverything to do with their accounts payable practices.\n\nIn my early freelance years, I would send an invoice and then wait for the\ncheck to come approximately 30 days later. When the payment didn’t show up, I\nwould politely send an email to the client to inquire about the late invoice.\nThe client would then say they needed to check with accounts payable on the\npayment status. Soon after, I would receive a reply letting me know when to\nexpect payment. I never knew for sure what happened after I hung up the phone\nwith my contact. Did they actually call accounts payable? Did they realize\nthey had never submitted the invoice in the first place?\n\nThere was a stretch of a couple years where over half of all invoices we sent\nwere not paid on time. When you are trying to run a business, cash flow is\nking. When clients pay late, it stings the pocketbook. One particular payment\ntook over six months to collect! First my contact couldn’t find the invoice.\nThen their accounts payable division lost it. Once the accounts payable\ndivision finally found it, they sat on it for a few weeks. It was miserable.\n\nWe have since changed our entire billing system, which in turn changed our\ncollections. Now we collect 90 percent of our payments on time. The magic\nhappened when we added one simple line to our email as we sent the invoice to\nthe client:\n\n_“Please confirm receipt of this invoice so that we can track it properly in\nour accounting system.”_\n\nThat line is money in the bank, literally! Wait approximately 24 hours and if\nthe client has not replied to your email confirming receipt, then send them an\nemail with this line in it:\n\n_“I just wanted to follow up and make sure you received the invoice I sent\nyesterday. Please let me know when you get a moment.”_\n\nAnd if the client doesn’t reply to that email, then a phone call is in order.\nThe trick to collecting on time comes by seeing the invoice submission all the\nway through. You must push that invoice through at the time of submission,\nrather than waiting until it is finally due.\n\nBy getting the client to confirm receipt, it entices the client to actually\nreact to the invoice, to print it out if necessary, and to submit to their\naccounts payable team. The point is that your clients will be more likely to\nreply to you and feel an obligation to take the necessary steps to get you\npaid.\n\nAn added bonus is that you rarely have to feel like the repo man trying to\ncollect your late monies. You’re simply following up on your friendly email.\nIt is the accounting system you are using that requires confirmation, not you.\n\nTry it. It works!",

While employee\nturnover is not too common at our company, it does happen. We have people who\ncome and work for us for a year or two; they build up their portfolio, get\nnoticed by other firms, and then move on. As I plowed through resumes in\nsearch of our new art director, I was reminded that a business is an organism\nthat wants to die. A business often seems like a lemming, doing all it can to\njump off the cliff and end its life.\n\nThere are times when things are good in a graphic design business. The phone\nis ringing. Work is piling up. You need a bulldozer to help sort the stacks of\nmoney. These times also come with challenges. The workload starts to cause\nlate nights for you and your employees, and the fast-paced production causes\nthings to slip through the cracks. You miss a deadline. Your quality drops on\na project or two. Clients begin to be frustrated, and all of a sudden you have\ngrumpy employees who are polishing their résumés and looking for new\nopportunities. Your success is now killing your business!\n\nOther times, things are obviously rough. The phone is not ringing, causing you\nand your employees to spend the day twiddling your thumbs, hoping and\nsometimes praying that you’ll get some work. You try some advertising but\nnothing seems to work. Your lack of success is now killing your business!\n\nGood times, bad times, it doesn’t matter: Your business is an organism that\nwants to die. This may seem like a negative point of view, and perhaps it is,\nbut I found that once I came to this understanding my role seemed clearer. My\njob as a freelancer-turned-business-owner was to provide 24/7 CPR support for\nmy business. Once I realized that my role was to keep my business alive in\nspite of its desire to jump off a cliff, things became considerably less\nstressful.\n\n![Image](../images/00128.jpeg)\n\nInstead of being shocked that an employee decides to move on to another\ncompany, I think, “It must be time for a little CPR.” Rather than getting\nangry that a client didn’t choose us for a big project, I think, “It is time\nto get out the defibrillator.” My expectation is that my business will require\na medical diagnosis and a little CPR every day to keep it alive. Every day it\nseems there is some type of CPR necessary: You need to send out another\nproposal, find a new employee, call a frustrated client, fix a broken process,\ntalk an employee off a ledge, analyze the financial numbers, design a new\nmarketing piece, replace a broken computer, buy some new software, learn\nsomething you don’t already know...this is the daily CPR that you provide to\nyour business to keep it alive. Your arms might get tired, but keeping the\nlemmings on the cliff can be fun if you do it with a positive attitude and a\nvision of the success that lies ahead.\n\nThe real trick in business is getting your business to stay alive without your\ndaily CPR. This requires processes, leadership, and the right team. It took me\nten years to get my company to this point and it is truly gratifying.\n\n* * *\n\nGOOD TIMES, BAD TIMES,\n\nIT DOESN’T MATTER:\n\nYOUR BUSINESS\n\nIS AN ORGANISM THAT\n\nWANTS TO DIE.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 96\\. If I’ve Got a Dollar, You’ve Got a Dollar, but No Partners\n\nAbout a year after I started freelancing, the owners of a local design agency\nasked me to go to lunch.

They had been in\nbusiness for a couple years, and we both had entertainment-industry client\nrelationships that had been cultivated from both of us living in Los Angeles\nduring the same years. It seemed we were living parallel lives.\n\nShortly after our lunch, the owners of this agency took an aggressive approach\nto try to get me to merge with them. My family was invited to their company\nparty. We wore their agency t-shirts. They broke down the financials and\nspelled it all out so I could see “how great” it would be. The temptation was\ngreat. At the time I was billing a little over $200K per year as a solo\nfreelancer.",

At the time I was billing a little over $200K per year as a solo\nfreelancer. I knew I had to grow, but had no idea how to do it. The thought of\npartnering with them would solve a lot of my future problems, and would make\nit so I didn’t have to go through the fear of hiring my own team and growing\nmy business by myself.\n\nI spent a couple weeks mulling over my dilemma. At a get-together with my\nwife’s extended family, I talked with my wife’s grandpa about my situation. He\nis the type of “sage grandpa” who has all the answers from a lifetime of\nsuccess in business. He heard me out and then shared a story with me about\nwhen he was young in his career.\n\nHe had worked his way up to where he was running a significant portion of the\nlargest construction business in the Salt Lake City area. He started thinking\nthat he deserved some partnership in the company, and he approached the owner\nof the construction company with a proposal for just that. He then shared with\nme a quote that was the answer to my struggle, “Bill, if I’ve got a dollar,\nyou’ve got a dollar, but no partners.” The owner of the company was more than\nwilling to treat my wife’s grandpa like a partner, but not to bestow legal\npartnership upon him. My wife’s grandfather ended up starting his own\nconstruction company, which made him millions of dollars during his working\nyears.\n\nI decided this was my answer. I would proceed with the mindset that I would be\nbetter off hanging on to 100 percent of my own thing rather than partnering\nwith another agency and having only a small percentage of something that could\npotentially grow bigger.\n\nI kept my eye on that agency over the years and even went to lunch with them a\ncouple times to talk shop. It seemed they were doing well, and so were we.\nBoth our agencies grew to the same size, around 15 employees at that time, and\nboth doing cool work for cool clients.\n\nThen, seven years after this agency had courted me, I had lunch with them\nagain. One of the owners had left the company to do other things. The owner\nthat was left behind began to tell me the full scope of their trials. They had\nnot had one profitable year since their inception. My company, on the other\nhand, had been profitable every year. They were on the brink of closing their\ndoors. We were maintaining profitability in spite of being in the worst\neconomy since the Great Depression. I was overwhelmed with a feeling of\ngratitude that I had made the right choice all those years earlier. It turns\nout that this agency closed their doors, while my agency is still thriving.\n\nI have people at my company now who are in the same shoes as my wife’s\ngrandfather—deserving of a partnership. I treat them like partners. They share\nin the profits and decision making of the company. But there is no legal\npartnership. They have all the upsides of partnership without the liabilities.\nIf I’ve got a dollar, they’ve got a dollar.\n\nWith a partnership it is easy to get lopsided in contribution. One partner\nworks more hours. Another partner seemingly brings more to the table. How do\nyou decide to fairly distribute dividends? Who wins the debate when you want\nto shift directions in the company? I’m not saying that partnerships can’t\nwork; there are countless examples that show when partnering is the perfect\nsolution. I am just cautioning you to make sure the merger is mutually\nbeneficial and to work out all the details in advance. This will help save any\npotential heartache and disappointment down the line.",

While the business presents\nunique challenges, the partnership has been one of the most rewarding business\nrelationships of my career.\n\nI’m certainly not trying to say you should never partner with anyone.

I\nhad been freelancing for about a year when the acclaimed author Michael Gerber\ncame to our state to speak at a business expo I was attending. He was\nenergetic and filled with wisdom. I was intrigued. Shortly thereafter, I\npicked up his book _The E-Myth Revisited_. If you are a business owner and\nhave not read it, shame on you. Even if you don’t own a business, Mr. Gerber’s\ninsights and advice are of great benefit to any working person.\n\nSeveral parts of the book had a profound impact on me. One is his instruction\non creating “Information Systems” for your business. In a very concise\nexplanation, the numbers you track tell you the story of your business.\n\n_“In short, the Information System could tell you the things you need to know!\nThe things you don’t know now...It tells you when and why you need to change.\nWithout it, you might as well put on a blindfold, have someone turn you around\nthree times, and set out with a dart in your hand, waiting for a signal from\nthe heavens to throw it. Not a very promising game. But one, it seems, most\npeople in small business are determined to play.”_\n\n—The E-Myth Revisited, _1995, 248–249_\n\nTHE E-MYTH REVISITED by MICHAEL E. GERBER. Copyright (c) 1995, 2001 by Michael\nE. Gerber. Reprinted by permission of HarperCollins Publishers.\n\nI was inspired. I met with my brand-new office manager and read her a few\nexcerpts from the book. We pulled out a spreadsheet and made up a list of\nthings we would start tracking. I remember saying, “Someday all of this data\nwill tell us a story that will help us make decisions for our business.”\nSeveral years later, that list of data became a crystal ball for our business.\nWe review the most recent data at the start of each month and have been able\nto make accurate assumptions as to what the future has in store for us.\n\n**Information We Track Monthly**\n\n• How much did we bill (revenue)?\n\n• How much did we cost (expenses)?\n\n• How much profit (or loss) did we make?\n\n• How many estimates did we send?\n\n• What was the average cost per estimate?\n\n• How many estimates were green lit?\n\n• What was the average cost per estimate that received a green light?\n\n• How many invoices did we send?\n\n• What was the average cost per invoice?\n\n• How much money are we waiting to collect (receivables)?\n\n• How much money is overdue for payment?\n\n• How many man-hours did it take to complete our projects this month?\n\n• How much did we cost per production hour (the hourly burn rate)?\n\n• How much did each employee cost per hour/per day?\n\n• How much money is in each account at the end of the month?\n\n• How many days before the first of the month did we have enough money green\nlit to cover costs?\n\n• How many working projects do we have that have yet to be invoiced?\n\n• Who were our first-, second-, and third-largest clients in the month (based\non dollars billed)?\n\n• How much did we spend on advertising this month?\n\n• What were our payroll costs?\n\n• How much were overhead costs (excluding payroll)?\n\n• When did employees receive raises and how much did that amount to?\n\nMany of these items are plotted on a line graph. This helps us recognize\ntrends in the data. Over several years of tracking this information, we now\nknow important things about our business, such as\n\n• June, July, August, and September are our busiest months.\n\n• One of those months will be 40 to 60 percent higher than what we bill in\nJanuary.\n\n• December is always our most expensive month.\n\n• December or January is usually our lowest billing month.\n\n• There is a direct correlation between the number of proposals we send out\nand the amount of money we bill. (This goes without saying, but we see the\nhard numbers and can then react appropriately.)\n\n• Money spent on advertising does not have a direct correlation with the\namount of money we bill (in the short term).\n\nThese are just a few of the things we know about our business from the data we\ntrack. This information helps make important business decisions. If you want\nto win the game, you have to know the score.",

A few years ago,\nwe had been asked to participate in the bidding process for a big project for\nDisney. This was an exciting project with six-figure dollars attached. We were\nfinally starting to feel like we were being asked to play with the big boys.\nOur team put the proposal together, which got Disney interested enough that\nthey asked us to fly out to Burbank for a “meet and greet.” Two of our team\nmembers were designated to go; they printed out a few copies of the proposal\nand jumped on a plane. To their surprise, what was named a “meet and greet” by\nour Disney contact actually turned out to be a conference room full of\nexecutives waiting to hear our team’s pitch. The Disney execs expected to be\nwowed by our organization and preparation. Instead, they were likely joking\nabout our idiocy after our team left. A few copies of a printed proposal and\nan ad-hoc presentation about how our team would execute on the project were\nnot enough to impress someone’s family pet, let alone a group of powerful,\nintelligent executives.\n\n![Image](../images/00129.jpeg)\n\nThis experience, combined with a few other awkward meetings, has taught us the\nvaluable lesson that there is no such thing as a “meet and greet.” Every\nmeeting, every interaction, every time you have an audience, you should be\nprepared to present what makes you and/or your company so awesome. This means\nyou should always be prepared with some, any, or all of the following: a\npresentation, a photo gallery of portfolio samples, a printed portfolio book\n(don’t always assume you’ll have a computer or Internet access), a brochure\nabout your business, a list of questions about your audience’s company, or\nperhaps a diagram of how you approach a typical project. Even a stone tablet\nwith chiseled dreams and goals is better than nothing. Whatever it is, the\nmoral of this story is to ALWAYS BE PREPARED.\n\n* * *\n\nEVERY MEETING,\n\nEVERY INTERACTION,\n\nEVERY TIME\n\nYOU HAVE AN AUDIENCE,\n\nYOU SHOULD BE PREPARED\n\nTO PRESENT WHAT MAKES\n\nYOU AND/OR\n\nYOUR COMPANY\n\nSO AWESOME.\n\n* * *\n\nIn my experience, meet and greets just don’t exist. But if you do happen to\nhave that first meeting in the history of design where the only thing that\npotential client wants to do is shake your hand and talk sports, then at least\nall of the great tools end up sitting under the table in your laptop bag ready\nfor action if called upon.\n\n\n## 99\\. How to Make a Capabilities Presentation\n\nA mere eight years into the creation of my graphic design business and I felt\nlike we were finally getting on the right track with business development. As\nI originally wrote this a few years ago, I was sitting in JFK Airport heading\nhome from a successful trip that was filled with business meetings with\nexecutives at entertainment companies and advertising agencies in New York\nCity. Until this point, we had been fortunate to land work without much\neffort. New clients would be referred to our company, and we would magically\nget the green light on projects. Unfortunately, due to the economic downturn\nof 2008 and 2009, we now had to work hard for work. On this trip we were ready\nto put our best, most polished foot forward.\n\nA few weeks prior to our trip, we were invited by NBC to give a “capabilities\npresentation” to one of their marketing teams. At the time we didn’t have one\nprepared so we spent about a week working up our presentation. The fact that\nwe didn’t have a canned capabilities presentation at our company after\nchurning successful projects for eight years leads me to believe that many of\nthe freelancers and small design business owners reading this book don’t have\none either.\n\nThe objective of a capabilities presentation is to tell the potential client\n“Who You Are” and “What You Do.” So don’t beat around the bush; come right out\nand tell them. We build our presentations in Apple’s Keynote software, but it\ncould just as easily be created in PowerPoint or any other related software.\nWhat is important is the flow of information.\n\n**Slide 1: Who We Are**\n\n**Slide 2: “Our Team”**\n\nWe show a quirky photo of our team, and we share with the client a brief\nhistory of our company and the awards we’ve won.",

Even though you may be really excited about\nthe amount and quality of the work you have to show them, your potential\nclient may not share that same enthusiasm.\n\n**Be brief and informative as you discuss your capabilities and projects.**\nFocus on results. Good design is always fun to show, but most clients are\ninterested in results. Make sure you have quantifiable results to share about\nsome of the work you show. Phrases like, “The year after we rebranded this\nclient, their company grew by 30 percent,” or, “After we launched this site,\nthey had over one million unique visitors in the first week alone,” are great\nthings to be able to say as you present to the client. Watch their body\nlanguage. If they are getting fidgety, not asking questions, or looking at\ntheir watch, you may want to hurry things up. A great way to bomb your\ncapabilities presentation is to bore your client and waste their time. You are\nbetter off speeding through it and following up with them at a later date.\nThat said, be sure that you have a leave-behind.\n\nWe usually leave a brochure with our clients that outlines a few project\nexamples and offers brief information about our company. Yours may just be a\nsimple flyer. Whatever you choose, a creative giveaway is always a good way to\nleave a positive impact. A freelancer once gave us a custom-printed skateboard\nwith our company logo on it; this type of thing is a great reminder of who\nthey are and the work that they do, and doesn’t get thrown away.

Floods Happen\n\nThe first three of my four self-employment years consisted of me slaving away\nin my basement. Forty-hour weeks became eighty-hour weeks, and my stress level\nwas through the roof. My wife found and convinced me to hire my first\nemployee, and my mother-in-law found my second employee. It was as if they\nwere bringing home stray puppies for me to adopt.\n\nMy basement office was at maximum capacity with three workstations—one in each\ncorner of the room—and a small television in the fourth corner to keep me\ncompany late at night. It didn’t take long for us to realize that we needed to\nfind some office space. My conservative nature led me to find some cheap space\njust down the street from my home. We signed a one-year lease and started\npacking.\n\nMoving day came and we hauled our desks down to the new office. Around mid-\nafternoon we were ready to move in our equipment. With excitement we dashed\nback to my home office to get our computers and monitors. At approximately\n5:00 P.M. we were finished. Our desks were set up. Our computers were plugged\nin and ready for a bright new future on Monday morning in our new office\nspace.\n\nApproximately 12 hours later, I was awakened by someone pounding on the front\ndoor to my home. I glanced at the clock by my bed: 5:00 A.M., “What is going\non?” I thought. I raced to the front door and recognized my neighbor outside.\nI opened the door and he yelled, “Your basement is flooding, I’m going to get\nhelp!” as he ran down the street. At that moment I recognized the sound of\nrushing water. I charged down to the basement and splashed into two feet of\nbrown water that now covered every inch of the floor. Fortunately, my\nwonderful neighbors came to the rescue and began helping to move all of the\nfurniture and stored possessions.\n\nAt the base of the mountain near my home there is an irrigation reservoir.\nSometime in the night, a chain had broken and a gate opened, which allowed the\nwater to rush out of the reservoir. The rushing water became a river flowing\nthrough streets and canals searching for lower ground. The river found my\nwalk-out basement and the water poured through our basement door.\n\n![Image](../images/00131.jpeg)\n\nThis experience taught me countless life lessons. One of the most important\nis, “FLOODS HAPPEN, YOU MUST HAVE DAILY BACKUPS OF YOUR WORK.” We didn’t. At\nthe time I had no file backups at all. I occasionally feared a hard-drive\nfailure, but never worried about it enough to back up my files on a regular\nbasis. Had my flood happened 12 hours earlier, I would have lost all the work\nstored on three workstations. All of our current projects would need to have\nbeen completely redone. All past projects would have been gone forever. It\nwould have been a disaster and I likely would have thrown in the towel on\nstarting a business and begun looking for a job. I am so grateful that I\ndidn’t have to learn this lesson the hard way.\n\nThe following week we implemented a regimented file backup strategy. We bought\nmultiple external hard drives and since that day, I keep backup drives onsite\nand offsite. My office and my home would both have to burn down on the same\nnight for our data to be lost.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to back up your data, and nowadays software makes it\nridiculously easy. I won’t go into the details of backup options. A little\nonline research can reveal many different strategies. Choose something that\nworks for you, but CHOOSE SOMETHING. If you are not backing up your computer\nfiles regularly, you could be in for serious and irreversible trouble.\n\nI don’t live in a flood plain. My home is in a neighborhood within a developed\narea. There are even several homes down a large hill from mine that would\nexpect to flood before my home. Nobody expects a flood, fire, or other\ndisaster to happen to them, but believe me, floods happen and lightning\nstrikes. You _must_ have daily backups of your work so that you are able to\nweather the storm when it inevitably comes your way.",

    "chunk_full": "## 101\\. Flexibility, Not Freedom\n\nI always chuckle a little when I hear people say something along the lines of,\n“It must be nice owning a business. I would love the freedom that comes with\nthat.” I always think to myself, “Freedom! This is the furthest thing from\nfreedom. I’m a slave!” If you are considering venturing out on your own to\nfreelance or start a business, be prepared to enjoy “flexibility”...but\ndefinitely not “freedom.” This chapter is dedicated to those of you\nconsidering taking the leap and going out on your own, as an effort to prepare\nyou for the flexible yet freedom-less life you will be plunging into.\n\nIf you are an ambitious business owner, the day never really ends. There is\nalways a fire to put out or an area that you can find for improvement. In my\nearly freelance years of working 80 hours per week, I used to love the evening\nhours when clients would be out of the office. The phone would stop ringing\nand the emails would stop flowing, and I could actually focus and get some\nwork done. Now that I have a team of people in the office, my “office hours”\nare pretty normal: 40 to 50 hours per week (in office). But as an ambitious\nbusiness owner, I have the privilege of spending my evenings reading business\nbooks, discussing business issues with my wife, and working through general\nstress management issues. I can’t count the number of late-night hours I spend\njotting solutions to my problems on scratch paper by my bed, for example. (By\nthe way, many of those solutions became this book.) Don’t get me wrong. When\nyou are ambitious, this type of life actually “feeds” you.\n\nThe fruits of freelancing or owning a business are many, one of which is\nflexibility. You have the privilege of deciding which 10 to 12 plus hours per\nday you want to work. If you want to run an errand or two in the day without\nasking permission from a boss or company manager, you can. If you want to take\nyour kids to the pool on a summer afternoon, you can. You have the flexibility\nin your schedule to do that. Just know you’ll likely be working later that day\nto make up for that lost time. When you work for yourself, there is no\n“salary” to cover for missed billable hours—what you work for is exactly what\nyou will get, whether for good or for bad.\n\nIt is also important to note that for freelancers or business owners, like for\nSpider-Man, “with great power comes great responsibility.” Since your success\nis based solely on how much you put into it, it will be sometimes difficult to\ndraw the line between working hard and smart versus becoming a workaholic.\nWhile nothing great was ever achieved without hard work and enthusiasm, take\ninto consideration your health and your family situation—working 22 hours per\nday may not be the best thing for you, or it may be just fine. The important\nthing is to think through all aspects of branching out on your own so that you\nknow going into it where you plan to draw the line—both with yourself and with\nyour clients and your workload.\n\nI’m not trying to paint an ugly picture of freelancing or owning a business.\nI’m merely trying to help you understand the lifestyle choice that is before\nyou. As for me, I’ll choose flexibility over freedom any day of the week.\n\n* * *\n\nWHATEVER YOU DO,\n\nNEVER, EVER\n\nDO UNDOCUMENTED WORK...\n\nNEVER, NEVER, NEVER.\n\n* * *",

I’m not quite\nsure why I have to learn it over and over again, since the emotional scarring\nis so painful. But, whatever you do, never, ever do undocumented work...never,\nnever, never.\n\nImagine the scenario. You sit in a conference room with your potential clients\nto discuss their logo, website, and brochure project. Over the course of an\nhour you amaze them with your ideas, creativity, and personality. You discuss\nthe budget and project scope, and they green light you to begin work right\naway. A week later they come back to your office to see your initial comps and\ndrop off their initial payment. As you begin to show them your comps of their\nlogo, website, and brochure, they remark, “Wait a minute. We thought you were\ngoing to do only the logo. We decided to hold off on the website and\nbrochure.” A cold sweat breaks across your clammy forehead. You just spent 20\nhours of your week doing comps for a project that you thought was green lit.\n\nI’m not saying you need to create a formal proposal or have a rock-solid\nemployment agreement in place before you can start working with a client or at\na new job. I’m simply saying that, by nature, people tend to have problems\nwith memory loss.\n\nThe next time you get a request to do any work from a client, take the couple\nminutes to shoot them an email that details out the project as you understand\nit to be.\n\n_Dear Lucy,_\n\n_Thanks for the call. I’m ready to jump on the project. Just to make sure we\nare on the same page, here are the details of the project: (insert details\nhere). I expect these tasks to take approximately XX hours, which equates to\nabout $XXX in fees. I’ll plan on including the hours on my next invoice to\nyou. If things start taking longer than expected, I’ll keep you posted on the\nchange in my estimated hours. Please let me know if this works for you! I’m\ngetting started right away._\n\n_George_\n\nAs this relates to taking on a new job, it may be surprising how many small\nbusiness owners don’t go through the formality of creating an offer letter. (I\nbelieve I’ve received an offer letter at only two companies during my career.)\nSince many designers end up landing at small agencies, there is a good chance\nthat you will be extended a verbal offer at some point in your career. Don’t\nlet your soon-to-be employer get away with it. Either ask them to send you a\nletter or email that details the offer, or do it for them.\n\n_Dear John,_\n\n_Thanks for the job offer. I am excited to begin working with you. Just so\nthat we have something in writing, here are the details we discussed: starting\nsalary will be $XX,XXX and the benefits will begin on XX/XX/XXXX. Can’t wait\nto start working together!_\n\n_Sally_\n\nDoing work without documentation is like getting in the fast lane on the way\nto the poor house. Quick emails like these can be a lifesaver as you review\nproject scope and billing with your clients, or take on a new position with an\nemployer.\n\n\n## 103\\. Next Worry Date\n\nNo surprise: 2009 was a challenging economic year. I was asked by a designer\nfriend whose own business failed, “What do you attribute your survival to?”\nImmediately I thought of the standard things: good customer service, zero\ndebt, hard work, stress, tears, sweat, hope, luck, faith...we exercised them\nall during that challenging time. However, one of the things that didn’t\nimmediately come to mind, but likely had just as big an impact, was tracking\nour numbers and reacting to the “Next Worry Date.”\n\nI’ve always been neurotic about my finances. Heck, I’m neurotic about a lot of\nthings. Every day our office manager posts our financial data on a secure site\nfor me to review. The data includes typical things such as\n\n• How much money is in each account?\n\n• How much money are we billing in each of the next three months?\n\n• How much money will we need to meet our expenses in each of the next three\nmonths?\n\n• How much money are we waiting to collect (receivables)?\n\nWatching hundreds of thousands of dollars come in and go out of our bank\naccounts every single month is very stressful.",

Then continue a constant assessment of\nwhere you are financially to keep yourself aware of where things are. This\nwill allow you to tackle each day with confidence and purpose rather than\nworking in a vacuum.\n\n\n## 104\\. Nickels and Dimes Are for Lemonade Stands\n\nSince the formation of our company, we have sent only two change orders. In an\nindustry riddled with scope creep, this is an unprecedented statistic.\nAdmittedly, this strategy has caused us to lose money on a few projects.\nHowever, the quantity of referrals and repeating customers that have flooded\nour agency as a result of our flexibility has more than made up for these\nsmall losses. Nobody likes to be nickel-and-dimed, especially when they are\nspending large sums of money.\n\nA few years ago we tried out a new accountant during tax season. Things seemed\nto be going well. They completed our taxes and were wrapping everything up\nsmoothly. Our representative at the accounting firm called me and told me that\neverything was finished and ready for submission; he offered to bring the\ndocuments to my office so that I could sign everything and they could ship\nthem off. I was grateful for this offer and looked forward to getting our\ntaxes wrapped up.\n\n![Image](../images/00133.jpeg)\n\nAbout a week later we received the invoice from our new accounting firm. Not\nonly was the bill for the tax work twice as much as they had quoted me, but\nthey had included a $25 mileage fee for bringing me the tax documents! I was\nshocked that they had charged me for something that seemed to be part of what\nI would consider good customer service. Call me crazy, but a $25 mileage\ncharge has no business showing up on a $3,500 invoice. Suffice it to say, we\ndropped the accounting firm like it was a cherry bomb on the 4th of July.\n\nYour clients will drop you, as well, if they feel like you are nickel-and-\ndiming them. There is no question about that. The trick is to price things\nright in the first place. Make sure there is a little bit of padding in your\nproposed project cost. Then, when a client asks for an extra tweak here and\nthere, you can accommodate them without feeling like you are losing money. It\nis also advised that you know where you stand financially on each project.\nTrack your costs so that you can go the extra mile when the budget allows,\nwithout having to bombard your client with change orders.",

We were excited about it, as it was our first iPhone app.\nThe only problem was we didn’t have any Objective-C programmers on staff.\nFortunately for us, we had a great relationship with an agency that\nspecialized in app development. We called and they were more than happy to\nhelp us with this cool project. We got a price from them for the pieces we\nneeded assistance with, and they got started.\n\nA few days later, the milestone arrived for designs to be sent to the client.\nOur outsourced agency said they had the comps ready, but they wouldn’t deliver\nthem to us until we paid the first invoice—an invoice they hadn’t even sent us\nyet! To them we said, “Fine, send us the invoice and we’ll pay it so we can\nget the designs from you and stay on schedule.” Inside our offices we said,\n“Do they think we’re a bunch of criminals? It’s like they are holding the\ndesigns hostage until we pay the ransom! We’re a successful agency a couple\nmiles down the road from them. Of course we’re going to pay!” This experience\nput a blemish on our relationship and made us feel as if our vender did not\ntrust us.\n\nAs a designer you have to take a leap of faith when you start many projects.\nBut trust is a two-way street. You get started working on the designs,\ntrusting that the client will pay. If you force the client to pay you first,\nthen they have to trust that they are going to be satisfied with your work.\nWhen our vendor made us pay their ransom, we became the only party in the\nrelationship taking a risk.\n\nAt our agency, we typically invoice a portion of the project at the start of\nproduction (25 to 50 percent depending on the size of the project). We get\nstarted on the work trusting that the client will pay the invoice. There have\nbeen times when we’ve had to halt production after an unusual delay in\npayment. There have also been a few times when a client never paid the initial\ninvoice and we’ve been out our cost to that point of the project.\n\nMake a careful assessment of a new client. If you get a feeling that they may\nnot be trustworthy, then you are absolutely justified in holding work for\nransom—or even waiting to begin the project until after you receive initial\npayment. Just know that sometimes a client with good intentions will be\noffended by your lack of trust in them.\n\nIf you do trust your client, don’t tarnish your relationship with them by\nholding your work hostage until the ransom is paid. If you don’t trust your\nclient, then maybe you should take a close look at whether you should be\nworking with them in the first place.\n\n![Image](../images/00134.jpeg)\n\n\n## 106\\. Oh Where, Oh Where Has My $100K Gone? Oh Where, Oh Where Can It Be?\n\nAbout two years into my career, I was hired by a direct marketing agency. It\nwas the mid-nineties, and I was the small company’s only “web guy.” There\nweren’t many “web guys” in existence at the time.

And that sentiment caused me to waste my energy in frustration\nfor what I was being paid.\n\nA business has many costs that are not known by the employees. When I first\nstarted hiring other designers to help me with my abundant freelance work, I\noften felt overwhelmed by the flow of money in and the flow of money out. Over\nthe years, this constant flow of money has helped me to gain a better\nunderstanding of why the $22,000 website I built was not quite as profitable\nas I once thought.\n\nHere are a few scenarios based on past phases of my small design agency to\nhelp illustrate where all the money goes. Before we get into that, let me take\na moment to define each of the expense categories. I’ve grouped many of the\nindividual elements into bigger categories to help us digest the information\nmore easily.\n\n**Expenses**\n\n**Project:** This category reflects things like stock photos, website hosting,\nand other elements necessary to complete a project for a client.\n\n**General:** Includes office supplies, networking group dues, subscriptions,\nclient gifts, postage and delivery, and other miscellaneous costs that occur\neach month.\n\n**Insurance:** Includes the company’s costs for health, dental, liability, and\nerrors and omissions insurance (required by some of our higher profile\nclients).\n\n**Occupancy:** This category is for all costs relating to office space,\nincluding lease payment, building association fees for common areas, security\nsystem, janitorial, telephone, Internet connection, and other types of\nutilities.\n\n**Payroll:** Payroll is the most significant cost for most graphic design\ntypes of businesses. In these scenarios, this category reflects the wages\ntaken home by the employees.\n\n**Payroll Taxes and Processing:** The employer is required to pay a matching\namount of your social security and Medicare taxes as well as state and federal\nunemployment tax. This category also includes the costs to an accountant or\npayroll company for processing payroll checks and taking care of the state and\nfederal tax payments.\n\n![Image](../images/00136.jpeg)\n\n**Freelancer:** It seems we are always using freelancers for some aspects of\nour businesses. This category represents those fluctuating costs.\n\n**Travel:** Most of our clients are out of state, which requires travel. For\nour business development efforts to be successful, we find ourselves making\nthe rounds with out-of-state clients about every other month.\n\n**Marketing and Advertising:** Magazine ads, direct mail, billboards, or\nwhatever works for your business would be applied to this category.\n\n**Monthly Expenses Scenario 1**\n\n**(Six-person design agency in a 2,000-square-foot office space.)**\n\nProject = $3,500\n\nGeneral = $1,500\n\nInsurance = $3,500\n\nOccupancy = $5,750\n\nPayroll = $19,750\n\nPayroll Taxes and Processing = $4,500\n\nFreelancer = $2,500\n\nTravel = $2,750\n\nMarketing and Advertising = $750\n\nTotal = $44,500\n\n**Monthly Expenses Scenario 2**\n\n**(Ten-person design agency in 2,000-square-foot office space.)**\n\nProject = $2,750\n\nGeneral = $2,750\n\nInsurance = $4,500\n\nOccupancy = $5,750\n\nPayroll = $34,000\n\nPayroll Taxes and Processing = $8,750\n\nFreelancer = $3,000\n\nTravel = $1,500\n\nMarketing and Advertising = $2,000\n\nTotal = $65,000\n\n**Monthly Expenses Scenario 3**\n\n**(Fifteen-person design agency in 3,000-square-foot office space.",

So, what do you\ndo with the profits?\n\nThe first thing to understand about profits is taxes. Everyone is lumped into\na tax bracket based on their income. If you have small profits, you have a\nsmall tax bracket. If you have a lot of profits, then your tax bracket is\nbigger. Tax brackets range from 10 percent to 39 percent of your income. For a\nbusiness, everything you bill above your expenses is taxed. For the sake of\nthese scenarios, let’s say the business is taxed at 30 percent. A business\npays these taxes on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe second thing to understand about profits is “nest eggs.” In order to\nsurvive, a company must have some cash reserves. Several different people have\nrecommended that a company like mine should have three- to six-month’s worth\nof cash reserves in the bank. That means if we are costing $101,000 per month\n(like Scenario 3), we should have somewhere between $303,000 to $606,000 in\nthe bank. The nest-egg money enables a business to ride out things such as\nlate payments (one of our Fortune 10 clients pays in 120 days, regardless of\nwhat you request on your invoice), getting stiffed (someday, someone is going\nto cheat you and not pay for the work you did), and economic turmoil (my\ncompany would have died during the 2009 recession if we didn’t have a solid\nnest egg to help us ride through the tough times).\n\n![Image](../images/00137.jpeg)\n\nEach month, from our profits we take out 30 percent for taxes and 50 percent\nto add to our nest egg. That leaves 20 percent to play with. In the past, the\n20 percent left goes toward things like computer and software upgrades, office\nupgrades, hiring new talent to help grow the business, employee parties,\nemployee gifts, and bonuses.\n\nLet’s take a look at Scenario 1 again, and this time, we’ll look at how the\nprofits play out.\n\n* * *\n\nAS A BUSINESS OWNER,\n\nNOTHING HELPS\n\nYOU SLEEP BETTER AT NIGHT\n\nTHAN HAVING\n\nMONEY IN THE BANK.\n\nNOTHING.\n\n* * *\n\nIn Scenario 1, we had a monthly expense of $44,500. Let’s say the company\nbilled $60,000 that month. “Wow,” you might think, “Let’s divide up that\nremaining $15,500!” Great idea! But first, let’s set aside 30 percent for\ntaxes ($4,650) and 50 percent to add to the company nest egg ($7,750). Take\nthose amounts out of the $15,500 and you have only $3,100 of profits left to\nplay with. Even if you structured your company to split that profit evenly\nbetween all six people, you’d take home only about $516 each. Nobody is\ngetting rich off of that. So that job I had as the “web guy” those many years\nago sort of fit into a scenario such as this one.\n\nNow you might be thinking, “How does anyone get rich owning a business?” Good\nquestion. I billed tons of money for years and didn’t feel like I had much to\nshow for it. I was keeping tons of money in my business’ nest egg based on the\nparanoia that we would need it to keep the company running off of that nest\negg at some point in the future. Then the magic day happened.",

Then the magic day happened. I looked at the\nbank accounts and we had a sizable nest egg in place. I had amassed several\nmonths’ worth of lifesaving money and it was all sitting in my business\naccounts. We had plenty of work and plenty of money. I set aside the 30\npercent of profit each month for taxes and every penny that was left became\n“extra profit.” Those were fun days in our business. We had a sizable nest\negg. We had tons of work. And the “extra money” was now piling up. We had lots\nof bonuses, raises, and employee perks. And I was able to take home lots of\nmoney on top of all that. Getting “rich” in business happens. It just takes\ntime to put the money in the right places before the “extra money” becomes\navailable.\n\nI have had several bankers and accountants dig into my company’s financials\nand applaud this financial strategy. They often cite examples of other\nbusiness owners spending their profits each month on cars, trucks, and other\nexpensive toys while not considering the need for a rainy day, nest egg, or\nfuture tax implications. To me, these considerations just makes sense.\n\nMy father-in-law used to say, “Spend a little, save a little.” Too many people\nforget the second part of that phrase and operate in a “Spend a lot, save\nnothing” lifestyle. As a business owner, nothing helps you sleep better at\nnight than having money in the bank. Nothing.",

I had so much client work piled on me I couldn’t see straight enough\nto try to figure out how to hire someone to help. I spent every day from early\nin the morning until late at night with my head down, just trying to get it\nall done. From time to time, I would leave my cave to attend a networking\ngroup of some kind. On one occasion, I sat with a small group of four business\nowners. We were chatting over the challenges we face in our businesses, and\nwhen it came to be my turn I didn’t have to dig deep to know what my struggle\nwas. I told them, “I’m buried in work. I’m stressed out of my mind. I don’t\nknow how I’m going to get everything done. And, by the way, I have to leave in\nthree minutes and forty-seven seconds. I just have way too much to do.” One of\nthe business owners shared this life-changing advice, “Don’t do anything you\ncan pay someone $10 per hour to do.”\n\n![Image](../images/00138.jpeg)\n\nGenius! Why hadn’t I thought of it before? Well actually, I had. I was just\nthinking about it the wrong way. I made the calculation this way: a $10 per\nhour employee will cost me roughly $25,000 per year. Even though I had plenty\nof money saved up, I was nervous about the $25,000 commitment.\n\nWhat I should have been thinking was: A $10-per-hour employee will cost me\n$200 per week if I start them out at 20 hours per week. I was spending 80\nhours a week working. And I was billing $5,000 to $6,000 per week. Even if the\n$10-per-week, 20-hours-per-week employee is half as productive as I am, they\nwill save me 10 hours per week. Which means I’ll be working 70 hours per week\nand still be able to net $4,800 to $5,800 per week. And if it doesn’t seem to\nbe working out, I can always let them go after a few weeks. So, my real\nfinancial risk is about $800 to test out this concept for a month. It is NOT\nthe $25,000 commitment I had assumed it to be.\n\nI made a list of all the things I had to do each week and then separated out\nthe ones that a $10-per-hour employee could handle:\n\n• Answer the phones\n\n• Pay bills\n\n• Go through the mail\n\n• Package up client deliveries\n\n• Make requested client changes\n\n• Test website projects\n\n• Proof print projects\n\n• Run errands\n\n• File paperwork\n\n• Send invoices\n\n• Follow up on late payments\n\n• Make bank deposits\n\n• Balance the checkbook\n\n• Order equipment\n\n• Update spreadsheets\n\n• Gather client assets\n\n• Backup files\n\n• Write blog posts\n\n• Manage social media\n\nAfter I finished the list, I realized that I was spending a lot more than 20\nhours per week doing all these things at the ultimate expense of the design\nand programming work that I actually could bill for. I decided to go for it.\nAs I’ve said before, my wife found my first employee and my mother-in-law\nfound my second employee. I was amazed at how much help these first couple\nemployees were. The problem was that these employees were freeing up my time,\nand that freed-up time was now being filled with new clients and projects that\nI could bill for. The next logical step was to hire more people, which was an\neasier decision this time around. By the end of that year, I employed six\npeople and had moved to office space down the road from my home.\n\nAt some point, as a successful full-time freelancer, you have to take the\nplunge and hire someone. Make your own list of things you are doing that can\nbe done by a lower-cost employee. Your goal should be to do only the things\nyou can do, and delegate the rest. Not every employee is going to work out.\nLook at each new hire through the lens of a simple one-month commitment. Make\nsure you have enough money set aside to pay them for that one month; if it\nworks out, you’ll likely fall in love with them during that month and a long-\nterm commitment to them will become obvious. If it doesn’t work out, don’t be\nafraid to cut them loose and try again.\n\n\n## 108\\.",

    "chunk_full": "## 108\\. “Skin in the Game” Usually Means “Free”\n\nEvery year we have several people come into our office with an “idea” that\nthey want us to build. Usually these ideas revolve around being something like\n“the next Facebook” or “the next Club Penguin.” Of course, these people\nusually have no money and want us to build it in trade for “skin in the game”\n(that is, a percent ownership in the new business or product). So far, in my\nown graphic design business, I have yet to agree to build anyone’s idea in\ntrade for skin in the game. I also have yet to see any one of these ideas that\nwere pitched to us actually get built (meaning that these same idea people\nwere unsuccessful in getting anyone else to build for them). I’m not saying\nthat you should never pull the trigger on building someone’s idea in trade for\nequity; I suggest only that you consider a few things prior to accepting a\n“skin in the game” deal.\n\n**Got any documentation?**\n\nIt is a bit humorous to me that most of the people pitching their “idea” to us\ndon’t have any documentation in place. There is no business plan, no request\nfor proposal, no strategy document—nothing. This is a big red flag and means\nyou are either getting in at the very ground level, or, more likely, the idea\nperson has no real clue what they are doing, and you should expect to have to\ncreate the whole strategy and execution yourself.\n\nIn this case, you should hold out for a larger percentage of the company if\nyou agree to build the product in trade for ownership. It is like someone\nsaying, “I have an idea. We should build a rocket ship that flies to the moon,\nand I’ll give you 10 percent if you build it.” Sure, flying to the moon is a\nfun idea. But the idea alone is not worth 90 percent of the ownership since\nthere is SO MUCH work involved in its execution. Be sure to make an accurate\nassessment of the workload and hold out for an appropriate percentage of\nownership.\n\n**“Skin in the game” usually means “free”**\n\nThe stars have to align for something like Facebook to take off the way it\ndid. Do your due diligence. If you are convinced that this person’s idea is\ngoing to take off and be HUGE, then go for it. But in most cases, there will\nlikely be no return on your investment. In fact, I recommend that you plan on\nzero return. If the idea is so amazing and exciting that you still want to\nwork on it even if you get nothing in return, then go for it. In certain\ncircumstances, I think it is valid to consider building out someone’s idea for\npotentially zero return.\n\n**Portfolio**\n\nIf the project will be a shining star in your portfolio, it may be worth\nconsidering doing it for free. Certain portfolio projects can help you land\nnew work or even break into new industries.\n\n**Charity**\n\nIf the project is for a good cause, it may be worth considering. There is\ndefinitely intrinsic value in doing charitable work.\n\n**Relationship**\n\nIf the relationships you build by doing the project have potential value, then\nit may be worth considering a partnership. Perhaps you feel strongly that\nthese relationships will lead to new and exciting opportunities. In the end,\nyou have to assume you will get no monetary return on your investment, and if\nyou’re OK with that, then go for it.\n\n**Define roles**\n\nIf you decide to partner with someone to build an idea, be sure to clearly\ndefine the roles. In a good partnership, those roles will be easy to identify.\nYou, as a graphic designer or programmer, will likely be handling the\nproduction aspects. This means that your partners should be overseeing the\nbusiness and marketing elements. Be sure to clearly define and document these\nroles prior to engaging in the partnership. If there is too much overlap, then\nyou are probably headed for some frustrating power struggles.\n\n**It will always be “their idea”**\n\nMost people pitching you an idea are looking for a way to get their idea built\nfor free. They are not necessarily looking for a partner in the truest sense\nof the word. They just don’t have any money or aren’t willing to spend their\nown cash on the idea. You must understand this prior to engaging in the\npartnership.",

If you are OK\nwith this and still want to build the product, then go for it.\n\n**A better structure**\n\nSpending internal resources costs you money. Whether you are a freelancer, a\nsmall team, or a large agency, every hour spent by someone in your company\ncosts you money. You should know what that cost is (divide your total annual\noverhead by the number of man-hours available, and that is your hourly burn\nrate). So, let’s say your overhead cost is $50 per hour. And you have a two-\nway partnership with someone to build a product. If it is an equal split, then\neach partner should put in $25 for every hour spent. Track all the hours and\nsettle up at the end of each month. If the idea person is interested only in\nyou paying for all the development costs but they want to retain most of the\nownership in the product, watch out...stormy waters could be ahead for you.\n\n**You get what you pay for**\n\nThis old cliché holds true in most circumstances. If you engage in an unpaid\nproject, it will probably become a pain for you when paying work piles up. In\nmost cases, the unpaid project will take a backseat to the paying work, and\nyour “partner” will grow frustrated with you as you lag in the development of\n“their rocket ship to the moon.”\n\n**Your best chance of success is staying focused**\n\nIn some years, we have managed to enjoy a 40- to 50-percent profit margin at\nour agency. Every time we are pitched an idea, we have to weigh it against the\npotential profits in our core business. Usually, a small ownership in an idea\nthat takes us off focus of our core business doesn’t make sense. Our agency is\nalready making money. Instead of spending our time and energy going off in\nanother direction to build someone’s idea project, we are usually better off\nspending our time and energy figuring out ways to generate more work for our\nagency and enjoying a healthy profit margin. Your potential is likely the\nsame.\n\n![Image](../images/00139.jpeg)\n\n\n## 109\\. Three-Month “Lifetime” Guarantee\n\nI come from a family where I watched my father work for the same company for\nmore than two decades.

My first year started out\nstrong, and then I hit a time in December when I had absolutely no work. I\npanicked for a few weeks and began polishing up my résumé just in time for\nthings to start picking back up about a month later, followed by a few more\nyears of successful freelancing.\n\nLater, as my agency grew, I hoped that perhaps I could expect a little more\nstability. I had saved up hundreds of thousands of dollars and was in a better\nposition to weather the storms of a graphic designer’s life. But then the\nrecession hit in 2008 and I watched several hundred thousand of my net worth\ndisappear in a few short months as I subsidized upside-down months and saw\nassets depreciate.\n\nThank you for indulging my trip down memory lane. If you’ve been working as a\ngraphic designer for a few years, your story is likely filled with your own\ntales of loss and insecurity. What I have learned is that life as a graphic\ndesigner really has only about a three-month guarantee. This is because most\ndesign-related businesses have about three months’ worth of guaranteed future.\nThey know what projects they are working on. They have a pretty good idea of\nwhat corporate decisions are being made. Consequently, it is safe to assume\nthat your job is safe for at least three months. Beyond that, who knows?\n\nEconomic volatility, fluctuations in client spending, mergers and\nacquisitions, and corporate restructuring can spell an end to your cushy\ndesign job. Enjoy the job while you have it.\n\nWhile running my design business over the past several years, I have seen the\nthree-month rule apply in a few different ways. When I first began hiring\npeople, I worried about increasing my annual overhead with each salary. I lost\nsleep at night worrying about how I would be able to pay my new junior\ndesigner $30,000 over the course of the year. What I should have been thinking\nis that I needed to make sure I could afford to pay that employee $7,500 over\nthe next three months (at the time, this was a fraction of the money I already\nhad in the bank). I have since learned, through experience, that the second\nand third sets of three-month hurdles always seem to take care of themselves,\nor at least, there is no sense in worrying about them before the fact.\n\n![Image](../images/00140.jpeg)\n\nWith the cash-flow fluctuations at our agency, we have also learned not to\nhire on a spike and fire on a dip. What I mean is that hiring a new employee\nduring a busy month may mean letting them go when the following month isn’t as\nbusy. But if you ride out a batch of three busy months and the future looks\nbright, that is the time to consider adding some heads to the team. And if you\nare a freelancer or small-agency owner, brace yourself financially for up to\nthree lulling months before you begin to decide whether it is time to let\npeople go or throw in the towel (see the chapter “[Next Worry\nDate](part0114.html#ch103),” earlier in this section, for examples of planning\nfor hard times).",

There are certainly exceptions to every rule. My point is\nthat by choosing to be a graphic designer, you’ll likely have to learn to live\nwith some occupational volatility. It seems to be part of the package.\n\n* * *\n\nBY CHOOSING TO BE\n\nA GRAPHIC DESIGNER,\n\nYOU’LL LIKELY HAVE TO\n\nLEARN TO LIVE WITH SOME\n\nOCCUPATIONAL VOLATILITY.\n\nIT SEEMS TO BE PART\n\nOF THE PACKAGE.\n\n* * *\n\n\n## 110\\. “Being Your Own Boss,” Whatever That Means\n\nWhoever coined the phrase “be your own boss” probably never was one. As a\nfreelancer or business owner, you certainly don’t have to ask permission to\ntake a lunch. But don’t fool yourself into thinking that “you are your own\nboss.” In fact, as an owner of a successful graphic design business, not only\nam I not really my own boss, I have about 30 bosses! Every active client we\nhave determines my professional future. Each of these bosses has the right to\ndemand things from me and my team. Sure, you can say “no” to your clients—you\ncan say “no” to your employer, too. But if you say “no” to your clients or\nyour employer too often, they will certainly go looking for someone else who\nwill say “yes.”\n\n![Image](../images/00141.jpeg)\n\nAdditionally, as a freelancer or business owner you get the privilege of “job\nhunting” nearly every week, as opposed to every few years like a normally\nemployed person. All potential projects require a résumé (we format them as a\nproposal for work), a salary requirement (we just refer to them as a cost\nestimate), and an interview (also known as a sales pitch).\n\nIf you are employed at a small graphic design business, you must understand\nthat everyone (including the business owner) is on the same team: a team\ndedicated to satisfying the needs of all the “bosses” and landing as many\n“jobs” as possible. The only real difference is the roles people play in the\ncompany. The business owner is typically the one trafficking the money, but\neveryone in the company is at the mercy of the clients and the ebb and flow of\nwork.\n\nDon’t get me wrong; the benefits of freelancing or owning a business can make\nit well worth it. Just prepare yourself for a lot of bosses and a lot of job\nhunting.\n\n\n## 111\\. How to Bite the Bullet\n\nI’ve been asked several times in my career, “I’m starting to feel like I want\nto quit my job and try freelancing full-time. How do you know when it is time\nto bite the bullet and do it?”\n\nWhen I started my freelance career, I didn’t have any other options. During\n2002 when I bit the bullet, the economy was still struggling to pull out of\nthe dot bomb and post-9/11 woes. Our group at Fox had been sold to Disney, and\nhundreds of people were laid off in the transition, including myself.\nFreelancing was my only real choice, and fortunately I had a couple key\nrelationships with individuals in decision-making positions who were feeding\nme enough work to get by.\n\n![Image](../images/00142.jpeg)\n\nThroughout the past several years, I have grown to see how fortunate I was to\nnot “go the way of the dodo bird” like so many freelancers do as work dries\nup. Thankfully, I had a few things in place that helped me survive. Here is\nsome advice to help you know if the time is right for you to bite the bullet.",

Thankfully, I had a few things in place that helped me survive. Here is\nsome advice to help you know if the time is right for you to bite the bullet.\nThe right combination of these elements can ensure your survival as a\nfreelancer and perhaps help you grow a successful agency of your own.\n\n**Money in the Bank:** Nothing will help you sleep better than having money in\nthe bank. When I started out I had managed to save about $60,000. At the time\nI felt like it was barely enough, but in hindsight I realize that it was\nplenty. I had no overhead other than paying for my family’s living expenses.\n\nLack of cash kills most freelancers. You have to have money to be able to ride\nout delays in payment and the occasionally client who doesn’t pay at all. One\nof our biggest entertainment industry clients pays their bills in 120 days.\nThat’s four months after we invoice them! We can invoice them net 30 and it\nmakes no difference. They pay according to their accounting standards and we\ncan’t do anything about it. I suppose we could not do work for them. But this\nis definitely the type of client you want to do work for: They supply us with\nhigh-profile and high-dollar projects. We have always made sure we have money\nin the bank to afford us the choice to endure their drawn-out accounting\nstandards.\n\nThree- to six-month’s worth of money is usually a good minimum amount to have\non hand. Figure out your business and personal monthly cost of living.\nMultiply that amount by three or six months, and start saving. On top of the\nthree- to six-month’s worth of cash in the bank, it is advised to have some\nopen lines of credit in place for a rainy day. At the start you may just want\nto get a credit card or two. We opened a large business line of credit with\nour bank several years ago. Keep the balance at zero and view these credit\nlines as “emergency only” options. Thankfully, we’ve never had to dip into\nours to keep our business afloat. If you ever get to where you are running\nyour freelance business on credit, it might be time to consider finding a\nfull-time job.\n\n**A Sugar Daddy:** Having a contract, retainer, or long-term project with a\nclient can be all the ammunition you need to feel secure venturing out on your\nown. An agency down the road from us has had a long-term contract with a large\ntech company in our area. This contract has employed over half their staff for\nseveral years, and provided them with the cash flow necessary to grow and\nexpand their agency in other areas.\n\nAt my agency, our biggest annual client changed four times in our first eight-\nyears, however in the early years of my freelance career I had an\nentertainment industry client who didn’t have an internal production team.\nThey outsourced all of their digital media needs to me and provided me with\n“sugar daddy” cash flow.\n\n**Contacts:** You cannot know too many people. If you are thinking of\nfreelancing full-time, take a close look at your pool of contacts. Leverage\nthe law of averages. The more people you know, the more people will know you\nare freelancing, and the more people will give you work. Get involved in\nnetworking groups, and don’t be bashful in letting people know you are looking\nfor new projects.\n\n![Image](../images/00143.jpeg)\n\nBe social online. Connect with everyone you know on both business and personal\nsocial media sites. Provide status updates on these sites to help raise\nawareness of what you are doing.\n\n**A Marketing Plan:** Figure out how you are going to market your services.\nWill you advertise in magazines? Online? Through direct mail? Relationship-\nmarketing only?",

Provide status updates on these sites to help raise\nawareness of what you are doing.\n\n**A Marketing Plan:** Figure out how you are going to market your services.\nWill you advertise in magazines? Online? Through direct mail? Relationship-\nmarketing only? Your marketing plan will be unique to your specific expertise,\nservice offering, and geographic location. Regardless of your situation, you\nwill want to set some money aside to begin the arduous task of experimenting\nwith different strategies until you find what works for you.\n\n**Fallback Options:** I have a great relationship with every boss I’ve ever\nhad. Unfortunately, for some of my ex-employees that is not the case. I’ve\nbeen shocked a few times as some of my employees have not just burned the\nbridge on their way out the door, but more accurately detonated a nuclear\nmissile on the bridge. You never know when you are going to need past\nrelationships. You may even need to put your tail between your legs and ask to\nget your job back if things don’t pan out with your freelancing aspirations.\n\n![Image](../images/00144.jpeg)\n\nWhen you leave your current employer to start your freelance career, be sure\nto keep your relationship with them intact. Don’t be afraid to have a candid\ndiscussion with them to let them know you feel it is time to try freelancing,\nand that if things don’t work out you hope they would consider bringing you\nback on. If you are an asset to their organization, they will more than likely\nbe grateful to have you back. We have had a few employees come back and work\nwith us multiple times. This is not uncommon in today’s business world.\n\n**Helping Hands:** Nobody is truly a “solo” freelancer. In order to succeed,\nyou need relationships with people who can be your helping hands. Begin now by\nbuilding relationships with people who will help you succeed. If you are a\ndesigner, you’ll likely need to know some programmers. If you are a\nprogrammer, you’ll need some designers. Figure out where your shortcomings are\nand find people who fill in the gaps for you.\n\n**Partner Companies:** Some of our most important relationships are with\nprinters and web-hosting companies. We can design cool print projects, but if\nthe printer does a bad job, then we look bad. The same goes with web hosting.\nThe coolest site design in the world is a total flop if the server goes down.\nBe sure to have a few trusted partners in place to ensure your projects\nachieve their full measure of success.\n\n**Mentor:** I wish that I had one when I started out—it surely would have\nhelped me avoid many struggles and hard lessons along the way. If you can find\nsomeone who you respect, who has been successful in the career track you are\nventuring into, and who is willing to answer an occasional question from you,\nthen you are one step ahead. Many successful people are happy to impart\nwisdom, but be sure to be respectful of their time. Success brings with it a\nmultitude of responsibilities, and their time may be very limited. I have been\nasked to act as a mentor for a couple up-and-coming design agency owners who\nhave one or two employees. Weekly calls and emails not only provide them with\nsupport, but they also help me to gain new insights on how to run my business\nby helping them work through their challenges.\n\n**Banker:** Talk with a banker and make sure you have all of your financial\naccounts set up in the best possible manner. Be sure to separate your business\naccounts from your personal accounts, as this will save you the possibility of\nan accounting issue down the road. Your bank can also help you put in place\npayroll once you start having some employees of your own.\n\n**Accountant:** I’ve changed accountants a few times during my career.",

Ask\nyour trusted contacts for referrals and find a good accountant or you’ll find\nyourself changing accountants, too. You’ll need an accountant to advise you on\nquarterly tax payments, as well as to work with you to file your annual tax\nreturns. A good accountant is a great resource to answer all your financial\nquestions. They can also help advise you and set up the legal structure of\nyour business. (Sole Proprietorship? LLC? Corporation?). Spending a little\nmoney on a consultation at the start of your freelance career is an excellent\ninvestment; getting things started correctly from the beginning can help save\nyou headaches later on.\n\n![Image](../images/00145.jpeg)\n\n**Insurance Agent:** It doesn’t cost much to get a little insurance. I\nsometimes joke that I “collect insurance.” Even a small business insurance\npolicy is something that every freelancer or business owner would be wise to\nhave in their start-up arsenal. If you start growing a company, your insurance\nagent can help with health insurance and other needs.\n\n**Financial Advisor:** Once you start finding some success, you’ll benefit\nfrom working with an experienced and knowledgeable financial advisor. These\ntrusted relationships can help you make smart financial decisions and put your\nhard-earned money into the right investment vehicles. Many financial advisory\nfirms also provide employee benefits services; as you grow, they can be a\ngreat resource to help you put in place retirement savings plans for you and\nyour employees.\n\n**Industry Relationships:** I love getting to know other people who are doing\nsimilar things to what I’m doing. I have had countless lunches with other\nagency owners and independent freelancers. I also have a group of business\nowners with whom I meet weekly. I consider it “alcoholics anonymous” for\nbusiness owners. In these lunches and meetings we provide support for each\nother, share best practices, and advise one another on business challenges we\nare facing. Start by inviting people to lunch who wear shoes similar to yours.\nYou’ll quickly find that you face the same challenges as many other people.\n\nYou don’t necessarily need all of these things to be in place in order to get\nstarted on your own, although as you progress you will likely find that all of\nthem will become important. Take a look at this list and, if you feel you have\nenough in place to bolster your courage to take the next step, it might be\ntime to take the plunge and start out on your own.\n\n![Image](../images/00146.jpeg)",

    "chunk_full": "[Prologue](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos3782)\n\nLIFE IS A game.\n\nThere’s no way to understand the human world without first understanding this.\nEveryone alive is playing a game whose hidden rules are built into us and that\nsilently directs our thoughts, beliefs and actions. This game is inside us. It\nis us. We can’t help but play.\n\nLife takes this strange form because of how we’ve evolved. Like all living\norganisms, humans are driven to survive and reproduce. As a tribal species,\nour personal survival has always depended on our being accepted into a\nsupportive community. We’ve developed powerful emotions that compel us to\nconnect with others: the joy of acceptance and agony of rejection. But once\ninside any group, we’re rarely content to flop about on its lower rungs. We’re\ndriven to rise within it. When we succeed, and receive approval and acclaim\nfrom our community, we experience happiness. We feel as if our lives have\nmeaning and purpose and that we’re thriving. These emotions, too, are no\naccident. In the millions of years in which our brains were being designed by\nevolution, the greater our status relative to the people around us, the better\nable we’d be to maximise our potential for survival and reproduction. Back in\nthe Stone Age, increased status meant access to better mates, more food and\ngreater safety for ourselves and our offspring. It still does today. So we’re\ndriven to seek connection and rank: to be accepted into groups and win status\nwithin them. This is the game of human life.\n\nNo matter where you might travel, from the premodern societies of Papua New\nGuinea to the skyscraper forests of Tokyo and Manhattan, you’ll find it:\nhumans forming groups and playing for status. In the developed world, we play\npolitical games; religious games; corporate games; sports games; cult games;\nlegal games; fashion games; hobby games; computer games; charity games; social\nmedia games; racial, gender and nationalist games. The variety feels infinite.\nWithin these groups, we strive for individual status – acclaim from our co-\nplayers. But our groups also compete with rival groups in status contests:\npolitical coalition battles political coalition; corporation battles\ncorporation; football team battles football team. When our games win status,\nwe do too. When they lose, so do we. These games form our identity. We become\nthe games we play.\n\nThis inbuilt need to achieve and maintain status gives us a thirst for rank\nand a fear of its loss that deforms our thinking and denies us the possibility\nof reliable happiness. It’s why, even as we raise ourselves so high above the\nother animals we appear to them as gods, we still behave like them – and\nworse. Always on alert for slights and praise, we can be petty, hateful,\naggressive, grandiose and delusional. We play for status, if only subtly, with\nevery social interaction, every contribution we make to work, love or family\nlife and every internet post. We play with how we dress, how we speak and what\nwe believe. We play with our lives – with the story we tell of our past and\nour dreams and plans for the future. Our waking existence is accompanied by\nits racing commentary of emotions: we can feel horrors when we slip, even by a\nfraction, and taste ecstasy when we soar. Up and down and up and down and up\nand down we go, moment by moment, day by day, from childhood to the grave.\nLife is not a journey towards a perfect destination. It’s a game that never\nends. And it’s the very worst of us.\n\nBut it’s also the best. We humans wouldn’t have raised ourselves above the\nother animals in the first place if it wasn’t for the peculiar and particular\nways we play at life. There are various strategies by which we can earn\nstatus. Humans strive: to be the best hunter, the best builder, the best cook,\nthe best technologist, the best leader, the best creator of wealth. The game\ncompels us to scheme and to innovate; to push ourselves to new limits in order\nto win. When we succeed, dozens, hundreds or even millions of others might\nbenefit from our play.",

It’s a game that never\nends. And it’s the very worst of us.\n\nBut it’s also the best. We humans wouldn’t have raised ourselves above the\nother animals in the first place if it wasn’t for the peculiar and particular\nways we play at life. There are various strategies by which we can earn\nstatus. Humans strive: to be the best hunter, the best builder, the best cook,\nthe best technologist, the best leader, the best creator of wealth. The game\ncompels us to scheme and to innovate; to push ourselves to new limits in order\nto win. When we succeed, dozens, hundreds or even millions of others might\nbenefit from our play. Humans strive, too, to be virtuous: to win urgent moral\nbattles, to rescue the imperilled, to lift strangers in distant continents out\nof poverty, to create vaccines that’ll defend the lives of people who’ll be\nborn long after we’re gone. All such endeavours are accompanied by the game’s\nracing commentary of emotions: the shame and the pride, the plummet and the\nhigh.\n\nOf course, life isn’t only driven by status. We’re also motivated by other\ngrand drives. We want power. We want sex. We want wealth. We want to change\nsociety for the better. But all these wants are best satisfied by playing the\nstatus game. If you want to rule the world, save the world, buy the world or\nfuck the world, the best thing to pursue is status. It’s the golden key that\nunlocks our dreams. And your subconscious mind knows this. [As psychologist\nProfessor Brian Boyd writes](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos677213), we\n‘naturally pursue status with ferocity: we all relentlessly, if unconsciously,\ntry to raise our own standing by impressing peers, and naturally if\nunconsciously, evaluate others in terms of their standing’.\n\nThis may sound like a depressing vision of humanity. In places, it is. But I\nbelieve it can also illuminate and inspire. It’s astonishing that our species\nhas evolved a system for rewarding ourselves and each other when we’re\nvirtuous. The result is courage and altruism. Likewise, our instinct for\nrewarding competence leads to innovation and civilisation. The qualities we\nvalue most in humanity are nudged into existence by the status game.\n\nBut of no less importance are this investigation’s warnings. By digging\nbeneath the flattering stories we like to tell of ourselves and revealing the\ntruth, we can see more clearly how easily we become tempted into delusion and\ntyranny. By understanding what human life is actually doing when it goes\nwrong, we can be smarter about avoiding its traps. Likewise, by understanding\nwhat we’re doing when it goes right, we can make a better future, increasing\nfairness, wealth and quality of life for all.\n\nSuch an understanding is critical. This book has been written in a time of\nrage and fear in the Western world. It didn’t seem long ago that our central\ncomplaint about the political parties of left and right was that they were too\nsimilar. What was the point in voting, we asked, when all you got were\nslightly different versions of ‘neoliberal’ capitalism? We don’t ask this\nanymore. The first decade of the twenty-first century has seen the Global\nFinancial Crisis, the invention of the smartphone and the rise of social\nmedia. The right lurched rightwards, towards Brexit and Trump, fuelled by pro-\nnationhood agendas; the left lurched leftwards towards identity politics and\nits new lexicon of insult: gammon, cis, bro, Karen, TERF, mansplainer,\nmanspreader, white, privileged, pale-male-stale. Families argued, friends\nbroke up, wrong-thinking citizens, celebrities and academics were mobbed and\ntoppled, global corporations sprouted political opinions, reading the news\ncame to feel like swimming through nettles. What was happening?\n\nPart of the reason we keep making the same mistakes, and tipping into groupish\nconflict, is that we play life as a game.

What was happening?\n\nPart of the reason we keep making the same mistakes, and tipping into groupish\nconflict, is that we play life as a game. Our brains continually, and in\ncountless ways, measure where we sit versus other people. They automatically\nlayer them and the groups they belong to into hierarchies. Most of these\nprocesses are subconscious, and hidden from us. But, crucially, whilst we play\nlife as a game, our conscious experience of it takes the form of a story. The\nbrain feeds us distorted, simplistic and self-serving tales about why they are\nabove us and they are beneath. In this way, complex truths become reduced to\ncartoonish moral struggles between good and evil. We’re all vulnerable to\nbelieving such narratives. They form our experience of reality. They make us\nfeel better about ourselves; they motivate us to strive to improve our rank.\nBut they’re delusional. They’re responsible for much of the hubris, hatred and\nhypocrisy that stalk our species. They can even drive us to kill.\n\nWhat follows is an investigation, based on research spanning psychology,\nanthropology, sociology, economics and history, into the hidden structure of\nhuman life. In order to reveal its secret patterns, we’re going to travel back\nto our evolutionary roots and to the Soviet Union, the Republic of Niger and\nan island community in Micronesia where they grow enormous yams. We’re going\nto discover what Nazi Germany, the British Industrial Revolution and the USA’s\nSatanic Panic of the 1980s have in common. We’re going to climb into the minds\nof anti-vaccination conspiracy theorists, misogynist spree killers, cult\nmembers, online mobbers and racists. We’ll discover a new way of defining\ntyranny – of what happens when status games go bad. We’re going to recount the\nstory of the world in an unusual manner: one in which self and culture change\nas the rules of status games are rewritten, mostly accidentally. We’re going\nto define three different forms of the status game – the dominance game, the\nvirtue game and the success game – and ask how certain kinds of play can lead\nus into a fairer, wealthier tomorrow. Finally we’ll attend to some practical\nadvice that seeks to assist us in playing our personal games of life.\n\nThe Status Game builds on two of my previous books. The Heretics (2013) asked\nhow intelligent people end up believing crazy things. I concluded we’re\nespecially vulnerable to irrationality when the ‘facts’ in question serve to\nboost or threaten the heroic story we tell of ourselves. Selfie (2017) was a\njourney into the self and the ways in which evolution, culture and economy\nshape who we are. It proposed (in an argument briefly reprised here in chapter\n25) that our highly individualistic neoliberal economy has thrown the West\ninto an unhealthy ‘age of perfectionism’. In the pages that follow, I’ll bring\nthese threads together and tie them into something new.\n\nIf you’ve arrived from my preceding book, The Science of Storytelling (2019),\nyou’d be forgiven for wondering if you’re about to tumble into a gigantic\ncontradiction. I went to some lengths to persuade you that your brain is a\nstoryteller and now, here I am, insisting it’s a game player. But as I hope\nwill become clear, this is actually a parallel argument investigated at a\ndeeper level. If the conscious experience is organised as a story, this book\nconcerns the subconscious truth that lies underneath.\n\nIn the years it’s taken me to research this subject, I’ve come to understand\nso much more about other people and why they can be so enraging, dastardly,\nconfusing and wonderful. They, and I, are no longer quite so mysterious.",

It was just after 7 p.m. on 9 April 1980 on\na school playing field in Brecon, Wales. ‘My life started then,’ said Ben.\n‘Everything before that is irrelevant.’\n\nBen was 14. His victim, Brian, was 11. Earlier that day, they’d escaped from\ntheir care home. In the grounds of an empty school they’d discovered a pile of\nbroken furniture and had a play fight. When they were finished, Ben\naccidentally let slip a secret. He couldn’t believe what he’d said. If his\nconfession was revealed he felt sure he’d be rejected by all of society, spat\non in the street, rendered utterly worthless. ‘There was no thought process. I\njust knew I’d told him and he’d tell the world. I was overwhelmed by emotion.\nWithin a second, I was hitting him with a chair leg because I knew I’d\ndestroyed myself.’\n\nBen ran to a phone box and dialled 999: ‘I’ve killed a boy. I hit him with a\nstick and I think I strangled him.’ Brian was found with a piece of his skull\nmissing. He died, three days later, at Cardiff Royal Infirmary. Ben only\ndiscovered he was dead when his solicitor told him, ‘Well, you know it’s going\nto be murder now. Did nobody tell you?’ When they sentenced him to an\nindefinite term at Her Majesty’s pleasure he was wearing his school uniform.\nThey took him down before the judge had even finished his summing up: ‘You\nkilled a boy without rhyme or reason. You brought his life to an end without\nany motive in circumstances which you know amounted to murder …’\n\nIn prison, they treated him as if he was worthless. During an early cell\nsearch, ‘they piled everything on the floor, all my clothes, bedding,\neverything I owned, then just marched out’. Ben was outraged. He refused to\ntidy up and slept on the floor for three nights. A direct order was issued. He\nstill refused. They sent him to solitary confinement. There he sat alone in a\ncold cell. This was his world now. He was a child murderer, the lowest of the\nlow. He had nothing. He was no one.\n\nBen attempted escapes. He tried to starve himself to death. At his first\nparole hearing, ten years into his sentence, he was denied release. They\ndenied him again and again. Twelve years, fifteen years, twenty years and then\ntwenty-five, Ben remained in prison. Then, in the summer of 2007, he fell in\nlove with Alex, a visiting teacher. ‘He wore khaki and had a beard down to\nhere,’ she told me.",

Then, in the summer of 2007, he fell in\nlove with Alex, a visiting teacher. ‘He wore khaki and had a beard down to\nhere,’ she told me. ‘He looked like a cross between Osama bin Laden and\nRasputin, and carried this dirty water jug filled with coffee. I asked, “Who’s\nthat?” They said, “That’s Ben Gunn. Keep out of his way.”’\n\nBut Alex and Ben began flirting. They had sex in a stationery cupboard. They’d\ncommunicate in secret, with Alex typing into Ben’s computer, so it looked as\nif she was helping with his classroom studies, but the words were of love and\ndesire. They’d swap hundreds of Post-it notes and voice recordings on memory\nsticks. Ben would call her on a contraband mobile phone at 12 p.m., 4.30 p.m.\nand 9 p.m. every day.\n\nBy 2010, Ben had been in prison for thirty years, three times longer than his\nminimum tariff demanded. He should’ve been released decades ago. But every\ntime an opportunity for parole came up, he managed to supply the prison\nservice with a new reason to deny it. [The MP Michael Gove, who’d been\ncampaigning for his release, told The\nTimes](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos677565) newspaper he thought there\nwas, ‘perhaps a self-destructive element in his make-up, because the prison\nauthorities always have a misdemeanour to report, some serious (never\nviolent), some trite, to prevent parole being granted’. To encourage him out,\nAlex would paint him pictures of the things they’d be able to enjoy together\non the outside: the cottage in the country, the fire in the winter, the cat.\nShe couldn’t understand it: he could have her and everything else he wanted.\nAll he had to do was behave. Why was he refusing?\n\nThen one day Ben told her straight: ‘I want to stay.’\n\n* * *\n\nIf life is as we imagine it, this doesn’t make sense. It was all there waiting\nfor Ben: freedom, love and a beautiful cottage in the Cotswolds. This was a\nreligious parable, a Hollywood ending, the archetypal story of heroic\nredemption. He’d atoned for his sins and here was his final destination, his\nglorious reward. But Ben didn’t want it. He preferred to stay in prison.\n\nWhat had happened to make him cling to life inside? How had he rescued himself\nfrom the psychological depths of attempting suicide by starvation? When you\ntake a human and strip them of all the esteem they desire, when you lock them\nin a dismal building with criminals and a prison staff that treats them with\nbullying contempt, how can they save themselves? How does a brain, with\nhundreds of thousands of years of evolution built into it, respond to such a\nsituation?\n\nIt builds a life for itself. A characteristically human life.\n\nYears earlier, Ben had started to study. He read up on zen Buddhism, military\nhistory, politics and physics. He gained a degree in politics and history, a\nmaster’s in peace and reconciliation, began a PhD in criminology and was\nappointed general secretary of the Association of Prisoners. ‘I became known\nas the subversive, the political animal, the jailhouse lawyer.’ He also became\na vegan. ‘Not so much a moral thing as being a pain in the arse.’ (One\nlunchtime, to annoy him in return, the prison service presented him a meal of\nmashed potato and boiled potato with a baked potato on the side.)\n\nBen made a life for himself by playing a game he thought of as ‘resisting\nabuses of power’.

He came to excel at it. In all his time inside, he only ever\nmet one prison governor he considered knew the rules as well as he did. Ben\nwould help other prisoners fight the system, sometimes tying officers up for\nmonths with densely argued appeals to the most trivial misdemeanour charges.\nHe became notorious with the officials. The parole board declared him a ‘fully\npaid-up member of the awkward squad’. He was a success. ‘He was someone in\nprison,’ Alex told me.\n\n‘And I knew that would change as soon as I got out,’ said Ben. ‘I’d go from\nbeing a medium fish in a small pond to being just another ex-con.’\n\nTo coax him out, Alex encouraged him to write a blog. The first post on\nPrisonerBen was published on the 31 August 2009. Readership grew to over\n20,000. In 2011 it was nominated for a prestigious Orwell Prize. And, finally,\nBen changed his mind. On 23 August 2012, aged 47, prisoner 12612 GUNN was\nreleased. Before he left, a member of the prison staff gave him a warning,\n‘You’re going to lose what status you have in here.’\n\n‘What did he mean by that?’ I asked.\n\n‘As a lifer you have a particular place in the prison hierarchy and as a\njailhouse lawyer, you do too,’ he said. ‘All these things give you status and\nI knew, as soon as I walked out, they’d be irrelevant.’\n\nAs far as I could tell, those officers had been right. Since his release, Ben\nhad been struggling. Thin, pale, shaven headed, rolling narrow cigarettes and\nsitting in the sunny garden room of Alex’s Cotswolds cottage, he’d vividly\ndescribed his collapse into despair. ‘On some unconscious level it was deeply\ndisturbing being released. I was sitting on the floor for two weeks rocking\nback and forth. I could see where I was in prison. I knew who I was and what I\nwanted to be. Now I’m completely lost. I’m imploding.’ And yet when I enquired\nas to whether the officers were correct in predicting he’d suffer from a\nprecipitous drop in status, he denied it.\n\nWhen asked why we do the things we do, we rarely say, ‘It’s because of status.\nI really love it.’ It can be distasteful to think of it as any kind of\nmotivating force, let alone a vital one. It contradicts the heroic story we\nlike to tell of ourselves. When we pursue the great goals of our lives, we\ntend to focus on our happy ending. We want the qualification, the promotion,\nthe milestone, the crown. If our need for status is so fundamental, this\ndiscomfort we feel towards it may seem surprising. But that’s the game. To\nadmit to being motivated by improving our rank is to risk making others think\nless of us, which loses us rank. Even admitting it to ourselves can make us\nfeel reduced. So our awareness of our desire for status eats itself. We\nreadily recognise it in rivals and even use it as a method of insult – which,\nironically, is status play: an attempt to downgrade others and thereby raise\nourselves up.\n\nBecause it has a canny way of hiding itself like this, let’s drag our quarry\nfrom its guilty corner. Status isn’t about being liked or accepted: these are\nseparate needs, associated with connection. When people defer to us, offer\nrespect, admiration or praise, or allow us to influence them in some way,\nthat’s status.",

Status isn’t about being liked or accepted: these are\nseparate needs, associated with connection. When people defer to us, offer\nrespect, admiration or praise, or allow us to influence them in some way,\nthat’s status. It feels good. Feeling good about it is part of our human\nnature. It’s in our basic coding, our evolution, our DNA. And it doesn’t\nrequire a stupendous achievement like scoring a goal in the World Cup or\nblowing up the Death Star. We can feel the velvet touch of status repeatedly\nthroughout the course of a single conversation or in the glance of a passing\nstranger.\n\nWhenever we’re in the presence of humans, consciously or unconsciously, we’re\nbeing judged, measured. And their judgements matter. Wherever psychologists\nlook, they find a remarkably powerful link between status and wellbeing. [One\nstudy of more than sixty thousand\npeople](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos677922) across 123 countries found\npeople’s wellbeing ‘consistently depended on the degree to which people felt\nrespected by others’. Attainment of status or its loss was ‘the strongest\npredictor of long-term positive and negative feelings’. Elsewhere, [an\nextensive review of the scientific literature\nconcluded](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos678306) that ‘the importance of\nstatus was observed across individuals who differed in culture, gender, age,\nand personality … the relevant evidence suggests that the desire for status is\nindeed fundamental’.\n\nBen’s story is a profound lesson in how to live. It shows us that it’s\npossible to survive everything being taken from us. We can become despised by\nsociety, classed a child murderer, and have a brutal force such as the prison\nservice ranged against us. We can hit such depths of torment that we refuse to\neat for forty-three days, starving until we feel our eyeballs drying out. And\nyet out of these circumstances of grotesque debasement, we can flourish. Ben\nbuilt a life of meaning and purpose and he did it by plugging himself into a\nset of like-minded brains and playing a game in which the goal was to earn\nstatus. His rank as a lifer and jailhouse lawyer gave him deference and\nrespect. He became useful to his co-players in their conflicts against the\nprison staff. He grew to be admired and valuable. He invested all the efforts\nof his days, months and years into the playing of this game. He created a\nworld of meaning for himself. Then, after prison, he collapsed. When freedom\nmeans expulsion from the meaning you’ve spent your life making, then freedom\nis hell.\n\n\n[2](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos3965)\n\n[Getting Along, Getting Ahead](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos3965)\n\nIF BEN CAN thrive in prison, we can hope to thrive too. There can’t be many of\nus who find ourselves as lacking in agency and opportunity as he did. How easy\nit should be!

The story we’re often told is that, with sufficient\napplication of self-belief and effort, we can do anything we want; be whoever\nwe want.\n\nBut it’s not so easy. The world isn’t as it seems.

That game\nhas its own hidden rules, traps and shortcuts. And yet almost nobody alive is\nfully conscious of its form, despite being active daily participants. So let’s\nattempt to wake ourselves up to the great game. Let’s try to define more\nprecisely what human life is and what it’s trying to be.\n\n[Humans are a species of great\nape](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos678778). We survive by belonging to\nhighly co-operative groups that share labour. We’ve been [living in settled\ncommunities for around five hundred\ngenerations](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos679141). But we existed in\nmobile hunter-gatherer bands for far longer than this – at least one hundred\nthousand generations. Our brains remain programmed for this style of life. We\nare today as we’ve always been: tribal. We have instincts that compel us to\nseek connection with coalitions of others. Once we’ve been accepted into a\ngroup, we strive to achieve their approval and acclaim.\n\nIf we’re to flourish, this approval and acclaim is critical. Researchers find\nthat in the kinds of premodern communities our brains evolved in, ‘social\nstatus is a universal cue to the control of resources’, writes psychologist\nProfessor David Buss. ‘Along with status comes better food, more abundant\nterritory, superior health care.’ It leads to greater access to preferred\nmates and ‘bestows on children [social opportunities’ that youngsters in lower\nranking families miss out on. When researchers analysed 186 premodern\nsocieties](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos679444) around the world, they\nfound men of higher status ‘invariably had greater wealth and more wives and\nprovided better nourishment for their children’. This was, and remains, the\nsecret of maximising our capacity for survival and reproduction: the higher we\nrise, the more likely we are to live, love and procreate. It’s the essence of\nhuman thriving. It’s the status game.\n\nEvolution has programmed us to seek groups to join and then strive for rank\nwithin them. But, especially in the modern era, we’re not limited to one\ngroup. For those of us not in prison, a typical life involves the playing of\nmultiple games. Wherever we connect with like-minded others, the game will be\non: at work, online, on the sports field, at the volunteer centre, in the\nclub, park or activist collective – even at home. The minimum requirement for\nplay is connection. Before we can be rewarded with status, we must first be\naccepted into the group as a player.\n\nPsychologists find that simply connecting with others and feeling accepted by\nthem can be profoundly good for us. But equally revealing is how our minds and\nbodies react when we fail to connect. A wide range of research finds [people\nwith depression tend to belong to ‘far fewer’\ngroups](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos679765) than the rest of the\npopulation. [Studies across time suggest the more a depressed person\nidentifies with their group](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos680206) – the\nmore of their own sense of self they invest in it – the more their symptoms\nlift. Failure to connect can even make us physically ill. Numerous studies\nfind it’s possible to predict mortality by observing the extent to which\nsomeone has meaningful contact with others. [One survey of nearly seven\nthousand residents of Alameda County in\nCalifornia](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos680573) found ‘the people most\nlikely to survive to old age were those with solid face-to-face\nrelationships’, writes psychologist Susan Pinker.",

Their social relationships,\nor lack of them, ‘predicted mortality, independently of how healthy, well-to-\ndo, or physically fit’ they were.\n\nDisconnection is a fearsome state for a social animal to find itself in. It’s\na warning that its life is failing and its world has become hostile: where\nthere’s no connection, there’s no protection. Isolation damages us so\nprofoundly it can change who we are. It can force us into a [‘defensive\ncrouch’](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos680876), writes psychologist\nProfessor John Cacioppo, in which we seek to fend off the threat of further\nrejection. Our perceptions of other people become warped. They start to appear\n‘more critical, competitive, denigrating, or otherwise unwelcoming’. These\nfaulty interpretations ‘quickly become expectations’. We can become scrappy,\nbitter and negative, a mindset that ‘leads to greater marital strife, more\nrun-ins with neighbours, and more social problems overall’.\n\nWhen this happens, we can become even more isolated and vulnerable to yet\nfurther varieties of antisocial behaviour. [Rejected people are more likely to\nissue punishments and less likely to donate money or help\nstrangers](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos681164). They can engage in\nself-damaging habits. In one study, [participants were told they were taste-\ntesting chocolate chip cookies](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos681498).\nBefore the test began, they were asked to mingle with other tasters then\nchoose two they’d like to work with. Some were told (falsely) that nobody had\npicked them; others that everyone had. The first group, who’d been socially\nrejected, went on to eat an average of nine cookies more than the non-\nrejected: nearly twice the number. Most of them even rated the taste of the\ncookies more highly, implying their rejection actually altered their\nperceptions of the sugary food.\n\nWhen our lives begin to fail, then, our minds and bodies fail too: we can\nbecome sick, angry, antisocial and increasingly isolated. We are, writes\nCacioppo, ‘[creatures shaped by evolution to feel safe in\ncompany](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos681955) and endangered when\nunwillingly alone’. But connection itself doesn’t make for a successful life.\nWe’re rarely content to linger on the lowest social rungs of our groups,\nlikeable but useless. We desire worth, acclaim, to be of value. There’s an\nitch to move up. In the oft-quoted [words of psychologist Professor Robert\nHogan](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos682262), humans are driven to ‘get\nalong and get ahead’. Or, from the perspective of our current investigation,\nto be accepted into status games and to play well.\n\nIf rejection from the game can make us sad, angry and sick, the effects of\nfailing to win status can be deadly. The epidemiologist Dr Michael Marmot has\nexposed the extraordinary power the status game has over our physical\nwellbeing. He spent decades analysing the health of members of the British\ncivil service. ‘Britain was and is a stratified society’, he writes, ‘and no\npart of it is more exquisitely stratified.’ This made it ‘an ideal\n“laboratory” in which to discover how subtle differences in social ranking can\nlead to dramatic differences in health, in people who are neither very poor\nnor very rich’.",

This was not, as you might reasonably assume, to do with the wealthier\nindividuals leading healthier and more privileged lifestyles. This effect,\nwhich Marmot calls the ‘status syndrome’, was entirely independent: a [wealthy\nsmoker just one rung below](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos682538) the\nvery top of the status game was more likely to fall ill, as a result of their\nhabit, than the smoker one rung above them.\n\nAnd these health differentials were extremely significant. Workers ‘[at the\nbottom of the office hierarchy\nhave](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos682805), at ages forty to sixty-\nfour, four times the risk of death of the administrators at the top of the\nhierarchy’. This remained true with every step you took up or down the game.\nThe lower you dropped, the worse your health and the earlier your death. ‘The\ngroup second from the top has higher mortality than those above them in the\nranking.’ [These remarkable and telling findings have been confirmed in men\nand in women](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos683089). [They’ve even been\nfound in baboons](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos683399). In the lab,\nmonkeys were fed diets high in cholesterol and fat until they developed\ndangerous levels of atherosclerotic plaque. The higher the monkey was in their\ntroop’s status hierarchy, the less likely they were to fall ill as a result of\ntheir nasty diets. When researchers conspired to alter the hierarchy, each\nmonkey’s risk of illness changed in lockstep with their change in status. ‘It\nwas the new position, not the one they started with, that determined the\ndegree of atherosclerosis they developed,’ writes Marmot. And ‘the differences\nwere dramatic’.\n\n[Tentative clues as to how this might happen come from the\nnew](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos683669) science of social genomics,\nwhich examines how our social worlds affect our genes and the ways they\nfunction. The basic idea is that, when we’re not doing well in the game of\nlife, our bodies prepare for crisis by switching our settings so we’re readied\nfor attack. It increases inflammation, which helps the healing of any physical\nwounds we might be about to suffer. It also saves resources by reducing our\nantiviral response. But when our inflammation is raised for too long, it can\ndamage us in myriad ways. It increases susceptibility to neurodegenerative\ndisease, promotes the spread of plaque in the arteries and the growth of\ncancer cells. According to a world leader in this field, Professor Steve Cole,\n‘several studies have related objective indicators of low social status to\nincreased expression of pro-inflammatory genes and/or decreased expression of\nantiviral genes. Being beaten down in the rat race naturally changes what you\nexpect from tomorrow, and that does seem to filter down into the way your\ncells prepare for tomorrow.’\n\nIt’s probably not a surprise to discover that feeling deprived of status is a\nmajor source of anxiety and depression. When life is a game we’re losing, we\nhurt. One review of the scientific literature found that ‘[perceiving oneself\nas having low rank compared to\nothers](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos683908) is consistently linked to\nhigher depressive symptoms’. Some psychologists argue that when we become\ndepressed we ‘[mentally withdraw from the competition for higher\nstatus](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos684395)’.",

Some psychologists argue that when we become\ndepressed we ‘[mentally withdraw from the competition for higher\nstatus](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos684395)’. This keeps us off ‘high-\nstatus individuals’ radars’ and conserves energy, helping us cope with the\n‘reduced opportunities imposed by low status’. Frequent defeat in the status\ngame has us scuttling off to the grey safety of the back of the cave. In the\nsanctuary of those shadows, our inner monologue can turn on us, becoming\nhypercritical in a process known as self-subordination. We talk ourselves down\nin an onslaught of insult, convincing ourselves the fight is useless, that we\nbelong at the bottom, that we can only ever fail.\n\nWhen we’re chronically deprived of status, the mind may even turn against\nitself and cause its own destruction. Although the causes of suicide are many\nand complex, lack of status is a known common driver. Tellingly, it’s sudden\nmovements down the game that can be most dangerous. [Suicide ‘concentrates\namong those](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos684926) who experience an\nincrease in their social inferiority’ and occurs mostly ‘when people fall\nbelow others’, writes sociologist Dr Jason Manning, who adds, ‘[the greater\nand faster the downward mobility](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos685321),\nthe more likely it is to trigger suicide’. Those who decide to end their\nlives, finally quitting the game that’s caused such agony, might have\nexperienced a recent financial loss, or have been made unemployed. They\nmight’ve lost reputation. They might simply have stayed still whilst others\nhave accelerated away from them: ‘[suicide is encouraged not just by falling,\nbut by falling behind](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos685648)’.\n\nThis game that we play is deadly serious. It’s only by surveying the damage\nthat failure can do that we begin to grasp that status isn’t merely a nice\nsensation, like the nice sensation of clean sheets or toffee apples. We need\nit. Status is an essential nutrient found not in meat or fruit or sunlight but\nin the successful playing of our lives. When we feel chronically deprived of\nit, or disconnected from the game, our minds and bodies can turn against us.\nTo our brains, [status is a\nresource](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos685995) as real as oxygen or\nwater. When we lose it, we break.\n\n\n[3](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos4069)\n\n[An Imagined World of Symbols](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos4069)\n\nWE DON’T FEEL like players of games.

The brain reads these pulses like a computer\nreads code, and uses them to conjure our perception of reality. The disturbing\ntruth is that all of this takes place inside the cramped bone vault of our\nskull. Life is a three-dimensional picture show, a story that we watch inside\nour heads.\n\nWe hallucinate our world into being. Writes the neuroscientist Professor David\nEagleman, [‘What we call normal\nperception](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos686321) does not really differ\nfrom hallucinations, except that the latter are not anchored by external\ninput.’ This anchoring of our perception into reality is the job of our\nsenses. But our senses are not to be trusted. Ears, eyes, tongues, skin and\nnoses don’t supply sounds, colours, tastes, touches and smells to the brain,\nbut ‘[a chattering stream of electrical\npulses](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos686612) racing up the thick\nbundles of data cables we call nerves’. The experiences the brain makes of\nthese pulses are acts of creation.\n\nMuch of what seems inarguably real and true, in the space around us, is not.\nThe actual world is monochrome and silent. [Sounds, colours, tastes and smells\nexist only](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos686911) in the projection in\nour heads. What’s actually out there are vibrating particles, floating\nchemical compounds, molecules and colourless light waves of varying lengths.\nOur perceptions of these phenomena are special effects in a brain-generated\nmovie. And our senses can only detect the tiniest fraction of what’s out\nthere. [Our eyes, for instance, are able to pick up less than one ten-\ntrillionth](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos687249) of the available light\nspectrum.\n\nSo the brain creates our experience of the world. Next it conjures us, the\nself at its centre. It is a hero-maker, manufacturing both the illusion of\nself and its gripping narrative, framing our life as a journey towards a\nhopeful destination. The story it tells even has a narrator, an inner voice\nthat chirrups away, performing a live improvisation of our autobiography.\nNeuroscientist Professor Michael Gazzaniga calls it the ‘interpreter module’.\nIts job, he writes, is to provide [‘the storyline and the\nnarrative’](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos687560) of our life. It\n[‘generates explanations about our\nperceptions](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos687868), memories and actions\nand the relationships among them. This leads to a personal narrative, the\nstory that ties together all the disparate aspects of our conscious experience\ninto a coherent whole: order from chaos.’ This story ‘may be completely\nwrong’. It often is. ‘[That “you” that you are so proud\nof](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos688140) is a story woven together by\nyour interpreter module to account for as much of your behaviour as it can\nincorporate, and it denies and rationalises the rest.’\n\nA psychologically healthy brain excels at making its owner feel heroic. It\ndoes this by reordering our experiences, [remixing our\nmemories](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos688404) and rationalising our\nbehaviour, using a battery of reality-warping weapons that make us believe\nwe’re more virtuous, [more correct in our\nbeliefs](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos689042) and [have more hopeful\nfutures in store](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos689500) than others.",

The most powerful of these weapons is\nthought to be the moral bias. No matter what we do, and how dishonestly we\nplay, the brain nudges us to conclude we’re ultimately a better person than\nmost. In one study, [participants guessed what percentage of time they\nexhibited a range of virtuous\nbehaviours](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos690044). Six weeks later, they\nwere asked again, but this time they were also shown the average ratings of\nother people. On the vast majority of behaviours, they rated themselves as\nmuch more moral than these normals. What they didn’t realise was the ‘average\nratings’ for others were, in fact, their own ratings from six weeks earlier.\nAnother study, comparing people’s self-image on a range of traits found that\n‘virtually all individuals irrationally inflated their moral qualities’. The\nresearchers wrote, ‘most people strongly believe they are just, virtuous, and\nmoral, yet regard the average person as distinctly less so’. Moral\nsuperiority, they concluded, is a ‘uniquely strong and prevalent form of\npositive illusion’.\n\nCulture conspires in this dream of human life. Cultures are built out of\nbillions of brains: billions of neural storytellers working in concert. They\nfill their religions, novels, newspapers, screens, speeches, gossip and\nideologies with simplistic stories of moral heroes and evil villains; actors\nbattling odds and fighting evil on their journeys towards promised lands. We\nall live the dream of the mind.\n\nTo reveal the hidden structure of human life, we must burrow beneath the\nillusionary story of consciousness and into the subconscious, an incomparably\nmore powerful place. It’s in these mysterious deeps that the vast majority of\nthe computation of life actually takes place. Despite how it feels,\n[consciousness is ‘not at the centre of the\naction](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos690661) in the brain’, writes\nEagleman, ‘it is far out on a distant edge, hearing but whispers of the\nactivity’. The subconscious circuits that generate this hallucinatory story-\nworld were ‘[carved by natural\nselection](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos690953) to solve problems that\nour ancestors faced during our species’ evolutionary history’.\n\nThe human brain is specialised for the games we evolved to play.\n[Neuroscientist Professor Chris Frith writes that it\n‘represents](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos691223) the world as a reward\nspace’. It’s coded to discover [‘the valuable things in the\nworld](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos691523) and what actions we need to\ntake to get them … everything around me exerts a push or a pull because my\nbrain has learned to attach value to them’. As we’ve learned, humans value\nconnection and status. In order to earn the resources essential for our\nsurvival and reproduction, we seek to bond with our co-players; in order to\nsecure more of those resources we seek rank. But how do we gauge this rank?\nHow do we tell how we’re doing in this game of life?\n\nWe do it, in part, by assigning values to objects.

It doesn’t only use inanimate objects\nas status symbols, it can project value onto virtually anything, including\npeople’s appearance and behaviours. Status symbolising acts in [one study of\noffice life included](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos692167) ‘always\ncarrying a folder’, ‘walking in a purposeful manner even if only to the water\ncooler’ and ‘displaying multiple clocks’.

In the luxury attire\ngame, the general rule is the larger the logo, the lower the status and\ntherefore price. [One analysis found ‘an increase in logo\nsize](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos693261) of one point on a seven-\npoint scale translates to a $122.26 price decrease for Gucci handbags and a\n$26.27 price decrease for Louis Vuitton handbags’.

This hum is thought to be an\n‘unconscious social instrument’ that helps sort us into status hierarchies.\nAnalyses of interviews on The Larry King Show found the host deferentially\nchanged his hum to match Elizabeth Taylor whilst Dan Quayle adjusted to him.\n\nThe status detection system is highly evident in the behaviour of youngsters.\nAround [three-quarters of arguments between children aged 18 and 30\nmonths](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos695625) are over possessions, a\nfigure that rises to 90 per cent when just two toddlers are present. For\ndevelopmental psychologist Professor Bruce Hood, possession is a ‘means to\nestablish where you are in the nursery pecking order’. The moment a toy is\nclaimed by one child, other preschoolers want it. ‘[Owning stuff is all to do\nwith status amongst competitors](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos695899).\nThese early disputes are a taster for later life in the real world.’ Just like\nthe adults they’ll become, these young status-strivers are hypocritical.\nChildren are [‘sensitive to inequality’, writes the psychologist Professor\nPaul Bloom](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos696178), ‘but it seems to\nupset them only when they themselves are the ones getting less’. Infants\nbecome upset when handed fewer sugary treats than others. 5-year-olds seek\nrelative advantage, often choosing to reject equal payouts of two prize tokens\nfor everyone, preferring one token for themselves if it means others get none.\nEven in children, ‘the inequality associated with relative advantage is so\nappealing that it overrides both a desire for [fairness and a desire for\nabsolute gain](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos696461)’.\n\nWhat starts as fights over playroom toys grows into the great battles of\nadulthood. We’re used to thinking of money and power as principal motivating\nforces of life. But they’re symbols we use to measure status.

    "chunk_full": "What starts as fights over playroom toys grows into the great battles of\nadulthood. We’re used to thinking of money and power as principal motivating\nforces of life. But they’re symbols we use to measure status. Studies suggest\nthat, unlike status, the [desire for power over others is not\nfundamental](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos697211) in humans. Unlike\nstatus, it doesn’t strongly predict wellbeing. Moreover, unlike status, the\ndesire for power is quenchable. ‘[After acquiring a moderate amount of\npower](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos697595), most people become less\ninterested in gaining even more,’ writes sociologist Professor Cecilia\nRidgeway. ‘But not so status.’\n\nLikewise, [the desire for wealth is not\nfundamental](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos697867). Status is the\noriginal form of currency, and the one that matters most. Studies show a\nmajority of employees would accept a higher-status job title over a pay rise:\none survey of 1,500 UK office workers had around 70 per cent choosing status\nover money, with creative assistants preferring ‘chief imagination officer’\nand file clerks opting for ‘data storage specialists’. Those data storage\nspecialists were onto something. Assuming we have enough money to live, it\nseems relative status makes us happier than raw cash.\n\n[This has been found many times](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos699012),\nwith one study using data from twelve thousand British adults concluding ‘the\nranked position of an individual’s income predicts general life satisfaction,\nwhereas absolute income and reference income have no effect’. Elsewhere,\neconomists find people’s [happiness goes down if others living\nnearby](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos699872) earn more than they do.\nAnd it drops most of all for those who spend time socialising in their\nneighbourhood. The effect is strong: ‘An increase in neighbours’ earnings and\na similarly sized decrease in own income each have roughly about the same\nnegative effect on well-being.’\n\nThis meets our understanding of how the brain works. It has to judge our\nstatus relative to everyone else’s, because that’s how it perceives. [For\nneuroscientist Professor Sophie\nScott](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos700360), ‘perception has no ground\nzero. There’s not an absolute truth about the world that we compare everything\nelse to, so it’s all relative.’ The status detection system, therefore, works\nin contest mode. [Researchers find our reward systems are activated\nmost](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos700548) when we achieve relative\nrather than absolute rewards; we’re designed to feel best not when we get\nmore, but when we get more than those around us.\n\nSome argue this is also true on the national level. As a country’s average\nearnings go up, they say, average happiness doesn’t. By the logic of the game,\nthis makes sense: if everyone’s getting richer at once, your extra pennies\nhaven’t bought you superior status. But the argument has been controversial.\nThis is partly because nations are so complex it’s hard to cleanly isolate the\nlink between economic growth and happiness. [Some data, using cross-country\nevidence, does appear to show rising national income correlating with rising\nnational happiness](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos701071). But,\n[according to happiness researcher Dr Christopher\nBoyce](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos701441), the increase is weak.\n‘That data just shows that economic growth is correlated (albeit very weakly,\nand not causally related) with higher life satisfaction. Statistically,\nwhether it’s across countries or across people living within the same country,\nthere is nearly always an effect of having more money on happiness, yet the\neffect is not large at all. And so whilst money can buy happiness, much of the\ntime it doesn’t or the effect is negligible.’ Meanwhile, [academics at the\nUniversity of Oxford’s Wellbeing Research\nCentre](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos701617) find that, as you might\nexpect, the less rich countries do see increases in happiness as the general\nstandard of living improves. But for the already wealthy nations, over the\nlong term, money makes surprisingly little difference.",

But for the already wealthy nations, over the\nlong term, money makes surprisingly little difference. [Between 1965 and\n1990](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos701993) the US economy grew by a\nhealthy 1.7 per cent a year, whilst Japan saw an impressive annual jump of 4.1\nper cent. In both nations, happiness barely budged.\n\nMoney is a status symbol, power is a status symbol, so is the size of a logo\non a handbag and the amount of orange juice poured in a glass. They’re Pac-Man\ncookies in the game of human life. Humans are extraordinarily imaginative\ncreatures who can turn almost anything into status symbols. [In 1948, the\nanthropologist Professor William\nBascom](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos702248) published an analysis of a\nstatus game on the Micronesian island of Pohnpei based on yams. Life there was\nlike life everywhere: stratified into rankings. At the top were chiefs, with\nthose beneath ordered along hereditary and political lines. Promotion to the\nupper ranks was difficult, but there was one rapid route to ascension. Men who\nbrought yams to feasts hosted by the chiefs could win significant status. But\nthe yam had to be big: ‘a man cannot win prestige by bringing a large number\nof small yams to a feast’, noted Bascom. The owner of the largest yam at a\nfeast would be publicly declared ‘Number One’ by his rivals and praised by the\nchief for his generosity.\n\nBascom found the men of Pohnpei in a state of symbolic war as they all\ncompeted to be Number One. Each man would raise around fifty yams a year,\npurely for feasts, growing them in secret, remote, overgrown plots they’d\ncreep out of bed at two in the morning to tend to, lining the pits with soil\nand fertiliser until dawn. A single yam could take ten years to grow, reach\nover four metres in length, weigh over ninety kilograms and require as many as\ntwelve men to carry into the feast using a special stretcher on poles. ‘That\nPonapeans are able to grow yams of enormous size cannot be doubted,’ Bascom\nwrote. ‘The reputation has spread at least as far as Truk, where yams are of\nminor importance.’\n\nA delicate system of etiquette bloomed into life around these yam wars. ‘It is\nimpolite to look at another man’s yams, and anyone caught doing so will feel\nthe shame of gossip and ridicule,’ wrote Bascom. Pohnpeians go so far as to\n‘pretend to ignore even the yams growing near the house’ which were only there\nto be eaten. When a man is named Number One at a feast, ‘he must not act\nproudly or boast openly about his achievement. When others discuss the merits\nof his yam, he pretends not to listen.’ This show of humility is partly a\ngame-playing strategy. ‘The man who is acclaimed “Number One” does not dare to\nridicule or laugh at the man with the second largest yam, or even the man who\nhas brought the smallest one, for fear that they may bring larger yams than he\ndoes to the next feast … and if the challenger has not brought larger yams\nhimself, he is publicly shamed.’\n\nThe yam game of Pohnpei might sound ludicrous, but it’s no different to the\ngames any of us play using orange juice, watches or fast walking in the office\nto symbolise status.",

In the 1950s, shortly after Bascom wrote his paper,\n[vehicle manufacturers succeeded in persuading the US\npublic](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos702706) that very long cars were a\nstatus game symbol. In one Dodge radio commercial a man exclaimed, ‘Boy, you\nmust be rich to own a car as big as this!’ Rivals Plymouth produced a print ad\nin which a family grinned by its extra-long vehicle, ‘We’re not wealthy … we\njust look it!’ Ford’s advert highlighted their engorged taillights, which ‘let\nthe people behind you know you are ahead of them!’ Such appeals worked all too\nwell. American cars became longer and longer. Great steel whales of the road\nbegan choking city traffic. Parking meters were torn up and spaced out at ever\ngreater lengths. City governors beseeched manufacturers to make cars short\nagain. Robert Wagner, the mayor of New York, declared they’d be buying no more\nCadillacs until they were shrunk, only to be defied by his own City Controller\nwho defended himself thusly: ‘The top officials of the city, for the dignity\nof their offices, should have Cadillacs.’\n\nThe status detection system never switches off. The game never pauses. This is\nwhy, especially in the public sphere, we can find ourselves playing hyper-\nlocal status games that are often fleetingly transient and can be between just\ntwo people. We might find ourselves playing a hyper-local game in a hotel lift\nthat lasts forty-eight seconds: who’s an employee and who’s a guest? Who’s\ngetting out at the plush top floors? Who’s that person not giving me the\nrespect I’m due by crowding into me? Who’s got the flashiest luggage? Hyper-\nlocal games pop up anywhere that people with a broadly agreed set of symbols\ngather. Australia’s Bondi Beach is a status game with hyper-local rules, as is\na self-help class, a nightclub, a queue for the bus and a gang of friends\nsharing a meal.\n\nThe anthropologist Professor Robert Paul writes that our pursuit of symbolic\nstatus ‘has to do with the fact that human social life inherently depends on\nthere being a public arena in which symbols can be made available to\nperception and shared by many people’. People who have connected ‘[share in\nthe perception of these symbols](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos702987),\nand incorporate them into their own thinking, feeling, and identity’, which\n‘means that they experience their consociates as “kin”’.\n\nIt’s in this way that we exist as a tribe, a culture, a people. We come into\nbeing as a collective when we connect with like-minded others whose brains\nprocess reality in similar ways; who dream the same dream of life. We\nrecognise the same symbols; play the same game. As we do, we become the source\nof each other’s status, the people of the yam. We see the yam, we know what it\nmeans, we experience a profound sense of connection with those who perceive\nthis reality as we do. We play the yam game as a single organism, feeding one\nanother status when we judge it’s been earned. Over decades of worry, strategy\nand toil we pursue it, using shared symbols to build great kingdoms of\nmeaning. These kingdoms – these virtual, connected, brain-generated\nhallucinations of reality – are the realms in which we exist. Our status game\nis a place. It’s our neural territory, our world.",

As neuroscientist Professor Chris Frith writes,\n‘[our perception of the world is a\nfantasy](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos703404) that collides with\nreality’. The dream state we exist in is founded on objective truth – we’re\nalive on a planet, breathing air under skies. But on these foundations we\nbuild an infinite variety of imaginary games. Groups of people gather\ntogether, agree what symbols they’re going to use to mean ‘status’, then\nstrive to achieve it. These symbols might take the form of money or power or a\nplastic dumper truck in a kindergarten toy box. They might be a luxury logo or\nsome sexy abs or an academic prize or a gigantic yam. The dream of the mind\nprojects value onto these symbols – so much value we can be driven to fight\nand die for them. It tells us a story that says they’re of glorious\nimportance: that our gods are real and our pursuit of them is holy. It makes\nus feel, not like players of games, but heroes on journeys towards\ndestinations of wonder. We believe this story. It’s woven into our perception\nof reality. It feels no less real than the planet, air and sky. But the truth\nof human life is that it’s a set of hallucinatory games organised around\nsymbols. These games are an act of shared imagination. They come into being in\nthe neural realms of those with whom we choose to play – our kin, our tribe,\nour people. These are the ones who truly understand us, who scratch the same\nmeanings as we do into the walls of the world.\n\nAnd yet this description of life remains incomplete. If our days only\nconsisted of groups of people lunging madly at prizes, civilisation couldn’t\nfunction. Monopoly players play for symbolic Monopoly money and locations on a\nboard and plastic houses and hotels. But you can’t just grab at them. Players\nmust adhere to precise codes of behaviour. The status game is no different. It\nrequires rules that players agree to. And, just like its capacity for\nprocessing status symbols, the brain has an extraordinary capacity for\nlearning and following rules.\n\nThe rules by which we play at life are impossible to count. Most of the time,\nwe’re not even consciously aware we’re following them: we just behave in ways\nwe’ve learned are correct and judge ourselves and others – measuring, removing\nand awarding status – by how well they’re followed. These rules were invented\nby our ancestors, both recent and ancient. We know how to live successful\nlives today because we’ve inherited instructions from humans who’ve lived\nbefore us. Their rules tell us how we must act and who we must be in order to\nwin. They’re stored in two separate places: as the anthropologist Professor\nRobert Paul writes, [there are ‘two separate\nchannels](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos703677) of inheritance at work\nin human life’. Each channel contains its own set of instructions. The first\nset was laid by our ancestors who spent millions of years living in mobile,\ntribal bands. This was the era in which our brains did much of their\nevolution. Everyone alive today is still coded to play hunter-gatherer games.\nThese rules are stored in our DNA.",

This was the era in which our brains did much of their\nevolution. Everyone alive today is still coded to play hunter-gatherer games.\nThese rules are stored in our DNA.\n\nHunter-gatherer rules were designed for a specific purpose: to help keep our\ntribes functional and their members working together peacefully and well. A\ngame was created in which prosocial behaviour that benefitted the group was\nincentivised. Roughly speaking, the more you put the tribe’s interests before\nyour own, the more you’d earn status and the better your conditions of life\nwould become. These rules were essential because humans can often be greedy,\ndishonest and aggressive. [One survey of sixty premodern\nsocieties](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos703942) uncovered seven common\nrules of play that are thought to be universal: help your family; help your\ngroup; return favours; be brave; defer to superiors; divide resources fairly;\nrespect others’ property. These elemental rules dictate the ways humans keep\ntheir tribes working well. They tell us basically how to play: deferring to\nsuperiors means ‘being deferential, respectful, loyal or obedient to those\nabove you in a hierarchy, using appropriate forms of address and etiquette’;\nreturning favours includes ‘repaying a debt, forgiving people when they\napologise’; dividing resources includes ‘being willing to negotiate,\ncompromise’.\n\nThese DNA rules are the outlines of human behaviour. They’re our basic\ninstructions for life. They’re common to us all and represent our shared\nhumanity. They’re why, if you put an Eritrean stuntwoman, an Inuit shaman and\na Slovakian chess master in a New York hotel room, they’d be able to cooperate\non a rudimentary level and then, after a while, an unstable hierarchy would\nlikely construct itself, with one on the top and the others slotted beneath.\nThis is just what happens when you connect humans into groups. The game\nemerges unbidden.\n\nThe second set of rules comes from people who’ve been around more recently.\nThey’re encoded in culture. Every culture has a distinct set of rules by which\nit wants its members to live. We’re judged by others, as we judge ourselves,\nby how well we play by them. Like the ancient DNA rules, they become so\nembedded into our perception that we barely know they’re there, unless someone\nviolates them.\n\nConsider the pub. Most English people who go to the pub enjoy themselves\nwithout thinking about what they’re actually doing. But pubs have myriad\nhidden rules. [Anthropologist Professor Kate Fox has\nnoted](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos704337) some of them. She writes,\nfor example, that the ‘bar counter of the pub is one of the very few places in\nEngland where it is socially acceptable to strike up a conversation with a\ncomplete stranger’. An extension of this ‘sociability rule’ applies to a\n‘limited extent’ near the dartboard and pool table, ‘but only to those\nstanding near the players: the tables in the vicinity of these games are still\nprivate’.",

Other rules obvious to the English, but not so to strangers, include\n‘one or two people, not the whole group, go up to the bar to buy drinks’; once\nat the bar ‘there is an invisible queue, that both the bar staff and the\ncustomers are aware of’; there’s a ‘strict etiquette involved in attracting\nthe attention of bar staff: this must be done without speaking, without making\nany noise and without resorting to the vulgarity of obvious gesticulation’;\nregulars are permitted to break this rule but only in a bantering style;\nthanks or ‘cheers’ must be said to the barperson ‘when the drinks are handed\nover, and again when the change is given’; the ‘First commandment’ of pub chat\nis ‘thou shalt not take things too seriously … even sticking to the same\nsubject for more than a few minutes may sometimes be taken as a sign of\nexcessive seriousness’. And so on.\n\nAround the world, there are gigantic shifts in the ways status games are\nplayed. These shifts can create some radical differences in self as brains\nform around local rules. Among the most studied are the differences between\nEast and West. Westerners tend to see status-pursuit as primarily the job of\nthe individual. This moulds their strategies for playing the game.\nPsychologists find that Westerners generally like to stand out and feel\nunique, [tending towards conceited self-\nviews](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos704597) and rating themselves\nbetter than average at all kinds of traits including [healthy\nhabits](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos704929), [immunity to\nbias](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos705273) and [driving\nskills](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos705615). In one study, [86 per\ncent of Australians](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos706114) rated their\njob performance as ‘above average’; in another, [96 per cent of\nAmericans](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos705854) described themselves as\n‘special’. [East Asian games tend to be more\ncollective](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos706420). In countries such as\nJapan and China, status-pursuit is more commonly seen as the responsibility of\nthe group. They’re more likely to feel raised up when they serve the\ncollective, winning status by appearing humble, conformist and self-\nsacrificial. In the East, it’s often the status of the group above all. This\nis a game plan that might sound worthy and wonderful until you consider its\nramifications for individual human rights.\n\nIt can also mean cultural tension. When we travel to different continents, we\nsometimes experience ‘culture shock’ as the behaviours we’ve been taught\nshould achieve acceptance and status begin to fail. Westerners who pride\nthemselves as being straight-talking, high-achieving and unique can be seen as\n[immature and uncivilised](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos706751) by\npeople in Asia. Over there the concept of ‘face’ is an essential component of\nthe status game. Sociologist Professor David Yau Fai Ho has defined three ways\nit’s possible to lose face: when ‘one fails to meet others’ expectations\nassociated with his/her social status’; when ‘one is not treated by others as\nrespectfully as his/her face deserves’; and when one’s in-group members (e.g.\nfamily members, relatives, immediate subordinates) fail to meet their social\nroles’.",

The Asian group-centred game can be radically different to that played\nin the West. There, if an employee is singled out for praise, their team can\nexperience a loss of face. The praised employee feels not elated but shamed\nand motivated to reduce their performance, deliberately doing a worse job so\nharmony and the group’s face can be restored.\n\nRules shift as you travel in geographic space but also as you travel around in\ntime; different people in different eras would’ve grown up playing radically\ndifferent games. Their variety can be found in popular books of etiquette that\nhave been written through the ages. [In 1486, Dame Juliana\nBerners](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos707143) laid out what kinds of\nbirds it was appropriate for those of varying status rank to use when hawking:\na yeoman could have a goshawk; a lady a merlin; an earl a peregrine; a prince\na falcon; a king a gerfalcon and an emperor an eagle. [In 1558, Florentine\netiquette writer Giovanni della\nCasa](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos707420) recommended to those sharing\na bed with a stranger that ‘it is not a refined habit, when coming across\nsomething disgusting in the sheet, as sometimes happens, to turn at once to\none’s companion and point it out to him. It is far less proper to hold out the\nstinking thing for another to smell, as some are wont, who even urge the other\nto do so, lifting the foul-smelling thing to his nostrils and saying, “I\nshould like to know how much that stinks”.’ [The Chinese Book of Etiquette and\nConduct for Women and Girls](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos707703),\nfirst published in the West in 1900, but many centuries older, says to:\n\n> > Honour greatly your father-in-law;\n\n> > Before him, let neither gladness nor sorrow\n\n> > Show forth in your face.\n\n> > Dare not even to walk behind him,\n\n> > Stand not before him when you speak,\n\n> > But to one side or behind him.\n\n> > And hasten his every command to obey.\n\n> > When your mother-in-law sits\n\n> > You should respectfully stand;\n\n> > Obey quickly her commands.\n\nThese were playbooks for the game of life. And the rules that were codified in\ntheir pages would’ve felt as real and true as ours do today.

We begin to take the form\nof a player of our particular time and place.\n\nAs we grow into childhood, these cultural rules and symbols are pressed into\nus by teachers and parents, with repetitive rounds of punishments and praise:\n‘good boy! good girl!’ When we do the ‘right’ thing, we feel ourselves soar;\nwhen ‘bad’, we fall. We develop a conscience, with its dreadful currents of\nshame, embarrassment, guilt and regret, but that also allows us to surf joyful\nwaves of pride. Our conscience provides us with a [‘social\nmirror’](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos708904), writes the\nanthropologist Professor Christopher Boehm. ‘By continually glancing at it, we\ncan keep track of shameful pitfalls that threaten our reputational status or\nproudly and virtuously chart our personal progress.’\n\nUp and down and up and down and up and down we go, as we play at daily life.\nThe rules and symbols of our time and place direct our beliefs, thoughts and\nbehaviour. They define us. We begin offering status to other people when we\njudge them to be playing well by our own internalised sets of rules. When they\nfail, we withdraw it. We perform the game, acting it with our muscles, beaming\nit from our eyes and singing it in our tone of voice. As well as being inside\nus, the status game is now outside us too, as we connect with other humans-\nlike-us and together create a world of meaning in which to play.\n\nThere’s no opting out of the game. It’s written into our brain and the brains\nof everyone we’ll ever meet. Some try to cure themselves of status-striving\nwith meditation. But meditators can become notably pleased with themselves. A\nstudy of around 3,700 who’d [practised specifically to ‘reduce attachment to\nthe personal self](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos709141) and ego needs\nsuch as social approval and success’ found they scored highly in measures of\n‘spiritual superiority’, agreeing with statements such as ‘I am more in touch\nwith my senses than most others’, ‘because of my background and experiences, I\nam more in touch with my body than other people’ and ‘the world would be a\nbetter place if others too had the insights that I have now’. Study leader\nProfessor Roos Vonk found the self-views they developed were ‘the exact\nopposite of enlightenment’.\n\nThe only feasible way to opt out of the game is to seek an empty room and stay\nin it. In Japan, more than half a million adults suffer ‘social withdrawal\nsyndrome’, refusing to leave their bedrooms unless absolutely compelled to.\nThese ‘hikikomori’ are [‘incapable of following the rules of society’, the\nsociologist Professor Teppei\nSekimizi](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos709781) has said.

We might earn it from something as simple as our\nage: young wins by the hotel pool; old wins on the train. Those lucky enough\nto be beautiful earn it from their looks. A major review of the psychological\nliterature found [attractive people are judged and treated more\npositively](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos710453) than the unattractive,\n‘even by those who know them’. Much of the rest of human life is comprised of\nthree varieties of status-striving and three varieties of game: dominance,\nvirtue and success. In dominance games, status is coerced by force or fear. In\nvirtue games, status is awarded to players who are conspicuously dutiful,\nobedient and moralistic. In success games, status is awarded for the\nachievement of closely specified outcomes, beyond simply winning, that require\nskill, talent or knowledge. Mafias and armies are dominance games. Religions\nand royal institutions are virtue games. Corporations and sporting contests\nare success games.\n\nIt’s important to note that these games aren’t strictly categorical. There are\nprobably no completely pure games, only blends of dominance, virtue and\nsuccess. One mode of play, however, will usually become sufficiently prominent\nthat it comes to define its game, like a flavour in a soup. A street fight can\nbe reasonably described as a dominance game but there also tend to be rules of\nvirtue in such contests (no hair pulling, no crotch kicking) and their outcome\ndepends on competence as well as strength. Similarly, the tech company Apple\nplays a success game when innovating, but also a virtue game when advertising\nits brand values and a dominance game when suing rivals for patent\ninfringement. The games played by boxers and chefs in Michelin-starred\nkitchens are fascinating for their being relatively equally weighted\ncombinations of dominance, virtue and success: they’re often brutally fierce,\nbound by tradition and strict codes of behaviour, and winners are celebrated\nfor achieving acts of extreme competence.\n\nThe same is true for us as players. The three varieties of game tend towards\nthree general varieties of human: we can be Idi Amin, Mother Theresa or Albert\nEinstein. But everyone contains elements of all three archetypes. Humans have\nthe capacity to source status from acts of dominance, virtue and competence\nand, crazed as we are, we’re going to use any strategy we can: a scientist, a\nprincess and a cartel boss will all use shifting modes of dominance, virtue\nand success as they play their games of life. We’re all a sometimes\nuncomfortable, often contradictory mixture of these three routes to the great\nprize.\n\nThe story of how human life took this form is the story of our species. More\nthan [two and a half million years\nago](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos711036), we were specialised for\ndominance games, being frighteningly aggressive prehumans about the size of\nchimpanzees.

Dominance is how animals\nfrequently play status games. When hens are brought into each other’s company\nthey peck at each other until a pecking order is established; crayfish circle\neach other before launching into a savage limb-tearing attack, the victor\nstrutting around in apparent triumph as the loser scuttles away.\n\nAlthough violence wasn’t the only way we gained status – in several primate\nsocieties, including our close relative the chimpanzee, nurturing\nrelationships with allies and maintaining peace among subordinates is also\ncritical – there’s little doubt we were far more savage then. Males would’ve\nhad murderous tempers that were easily triggered by rivals. ‘[Reactive\naggression would have dominated](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos711889)\nsocial life in the same way as it does in most social primates,’ writes\nanthropologist Professor Richard Wrangham. Evidence, including that of our\nonce ‘massive faces’, suggests we most likely ‘continued to physically fight,\none on one, until at [least the Mid-\nPleistocene](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos712169)’ – roughly between\n770,000 and 126,000 years ago.\n\nWe shifted away from fist and fang when we began playing games with symbols in\nthe communal imagination. Accounts of how and why this happened can only be\nspeculative and are debated hotly. Some believe that, [after we came down from\nthe trees](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos712460), the threat from\npredators huddled us into protective groups. As living became denser, males\nfound themselves with more rivals to fight off, so began shifting their mating\nstrategy towards one of pair-bonding, in which they’d offer meat and\nprotection to females in return for preferred sexual access. These emergent\nfamilies became extended, with grandparents, uncles and aunts building\nsustained relationships and sharing childrearing responsibilities. When women\npair-bonded with males from different families, loose tribes or clans formed.\nClose-living meant close-learning and the ability for rules and symbols to be\ncommunicated down the generations.\n\nFor biologist Professor Edward O. Wilson [our use of\ncampsites](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos712742), beginning perhaps a\nmillion years ago, was another critical event. He describes them as human\n‘nests’ and observes that all animals ‘without exception’ that have achieved\nthe intense mode of survival-through-cooperation of which we’re capable have\nlived this way. Like them we ‘raised young in the nest, foraged away from it\nfor food, and brought the bounty back to share with others’. Nested life meant\ndividing labour, sharing resources, defending our nests in teams and launching\nraids on the nests of others.\n\nIn this communal, nested world, brute ferocity by alpha males was unwelcome\nand unuseful. Getting along and getting ahead meant winning the cooperation of\nothers. [Hyper-violent males who attempted to\ndominate](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos712992) the tribe would\nincreasingly find themselves ostracized or executed.

Our skeletons changed, our brains changed and our ways of living\nchanged too.\n\nWe still had our ancient predisposition to self-organise into ranks: our\nancestors had [‘clearly defined status\nhierarchies’](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos713549), writes psychologist\nProfessor David Buss, ‘with resources flowing freely to those at the top and\ntrickling slowly to those at the bottom’. These [hierarchies would’ve\nnaturally divided](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos713808) into young and\nold, and male versus male, [as they competed for\nfemales](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos714078), and female versus\nfemale, as they competed for males. In a possible hangover from our alpha male\ndominated prehuman days that would have some dreadful consequences for women\nwe’re still battling today, [men were often automatically granted higher\nstatus](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos714325). But newer subdivisions\nalso emerged, as we learned to specialise in tasks that were necessary to keep\nthe group functioning.\n\nAnd so our status games began shifting into the realm of shared imagination.\nWhat mattered increasingly was not how brutal we were, but what our co-players\nthought of us. We could earn this kind of prestige-based status by showing we\nwere useful to the group. We could do this in two ways. Firstly, by being\nsuccessful, demonstrating knowledge and skill that benefitted others. We could\ntell great stories, accurately predict the future, be an excellent hunter,\nsorcerer, [toolmaker, tracker](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos714640) or\nhoney-finder. [In Panama, members of the Kuna\ntribe](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos715284) play success games by\nkeeping a lifetime record of their tapir kills, those with the highest number\nreceiving heightened status. Similarly, the best turtle hunters among the\nMeriam people of the Torres Strait earn respect from village elders and have\ntheir opinions disproportionately supported in public meetings and private\ndisputes.\n\nSecondly, we could earn prestige-based status by being virtuous: by\ndemonstrating beliefs or behaviours that served the group’s interests. This\nkind of status is awarded to those who show concern for the public good,\ndisplay commitment to the group or enforce its rules. They’ll also rise up the\nrankings if they’re thought of as being courageous or generous towards their\nco-players. In Tanzania, Hadza hunters who share meat widely ‘[gain great\nsocial status](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos715605) – prestige that can\nbe parlayed into powerful social alliances, the deference of other men, and\ngreater mating success’, writes Buss. People engage in [‘competitive\naltruism’](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos715853), battling to be ‘seen\nby others as great contributors to the group’. Of course, status is awarded to\nthe altruistic in more modern societies too: studies show those who donate to\ncharity, for example, experience ‘[a dramatic boost in\nprestige](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos716098) in the eyes of others’.\n\nIn order to be able to play the two varieties of prestige game, our brains had\nto develop an unusual ability. Prestige games are symbolic. Unlike physical\ndominance contests, they’re not played with our actual selves, but with our\nreputation. We can think of our reputation as a symbolic version of us that\nexists in the minds of others. Human brains required the capacity to store\nthese highly detailed symbolic selves.",

We can think of our reputation as a symbolic version of us that\nexists in the minds of others. Human brains required the capacity to store\nthese highly detailed symbolic selves. Our neural worlds are crowded with\nhallucinations of others so vivid they can almost be summoned at will. We all\nwalk around with everyone we know crowded inside our heads.\n\nAdditionally, we needed to be able to talk. We might’ve stored the reputations\nof others in our brains, but those reputations lived and died in the stories\nwe told of them. The current dominant theory says [this is why we evolved\nspeech – to gossip](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos716351). If others in\nthe tribe spoke well of us, we’d be rewarded with a prestigious reputation and\nits glittering dividends; if bad, we’d sink in the rankings and risk\npunishment. We could also gain status from gossiping. [Who we gossip with can\nitself be a status symbol](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos716646):\nswapping tattle with high-ranked others implies we’re of high rank too.\nFurthermore, [one of gossip’s critical purposes was to demonstrate the\nrules](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos716833) of the tribe and what\nhappened if you broke them. By gossiping we demonstrate our knowledge of the\nrules, and our loyalty to them, and this can also earn status. Gossip has been\ndescribed as ‘[an activity that is attention\nseeking](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos717324), promoting self-interest\nand self-image through social comparison, and the discrediting of others’.\nIt’s [universal and essential to our\ngameplay](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos717759): [children start to\ngossip almost as soon as they can\nspeak](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos718013).\n\nAs well as in gossip, a tribe’s rules and symbols would’ve been encoded in\nmyths and legends told by elders, in rituals and ceremonies and the dress and\nbehaviour of others. As we grew up, we’d internalise these rules and symbols,\ndeveloping a conscience, a kind of imaginary tribe that would judge us and\nwarn us when we’d erred. Breaking the rules by failing to share meat, say, or\nperforming incorrectly in a ritual, ‘[meant facing reputational\ndamage](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos718497), diminishing mating\nprospects, ostracism and, in the extreme, execution by the group’, writes\nbiologist Professor Joseph Henrich. ‘Natural selection shaped our psychology\nto make us docile, ashamed at norm violations, and adept at acquiring and\ninternalising social norms.’\n\nAs the ways we played for status changed, we slowly transmuted into the weird,\nstrutting, mind-haunted, jewel-sparkling animals we’d recognise today. We\nbegan indulging in status-seeking activities such as painting, playing musical\ninstruments, wearing elaborate jewellery and making, trading and displaying\ncovetous objects. In Germany, [a 40,000-year-old figurine of a lion-\nman](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos718777) has been discovered that it’s\nthought would’ve taken over four hundred hours for a skilled artisan to make.\n[In the Ukraine, the remains of four monumental\nstructures](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos719027) built from vast\ninterlocking mammoth bones have been found, with some of the skulls in the\nbuildings weighing at least one hundred kilograms.",

Thought to be over twenty\nthousand years old, they housed treasures such as amber ornaments and fossil\nshells, some of which had been brought, and probably traded, from over five\nhundred kilometres away.\n\nWe were becoming more vain and also more virtuous. Our shift from playing\ndominance games to reputation games led to our being incredibly tolerant when\ndealing with members of our own group, compared to our primate relatives.\nPhysical aggression between humans happens at [a frequency of less than one\nper cent](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos719294) compared to chimpanzees\nand bonobos. Chimpanzee troops have been found to be [‘several hundred to a\nthousand times’ more aggressive](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos719564)\nthan even the most violent human societies. We don’t need to tear each other’s\nlimbs and genitals off and drink their blood for status, as chimpanzees do,\nwhen we can earn it by raising our prestige and displaying our ranking with\nivory lions and glittering shells.\n\nGames of prestige are played everywhere from the jungles and savannahs of\npremodern societies to the avenues and skyscrapers of the glittering cities.\nIt was once assumed only humans used prestige but it’s since been detected in\nother animals, such as when a wise old elephant leads her herd to water. But\nno species has taken it anywhere near as far as us. Prestige is our most\nmarvellous craving. It’s a bribe that induces us into being useful,\nbenefitting the interests of the tribe. It’s enabled us to master the art of\nco-operative living. We pursue goals, and tackle problems, as members of\ncollaborative groups because we’re programmed to care deeply about what our\nco-players think of us: we revel in the reward of status they supply. When we\nstrive to earn a good, prestigious reputation using either of the two\navailable strategies – by being virtuous or successful – we progress. This is\nthe secret of our success as a species and has enabled us to dominate the\nplanet. As anthropologist Dr Jerome Barkow has written, ‘[Without symbolic\nprestige](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos719854), it’s difficult to see\nhow complex societies could have developed.’\n\nBut there are downsides. Because our brains value reputational status so\nfundamentally, its loss can feel unbearable. In some societies, [such as that\nof the Lepcha in the Himalayas](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos720362),\nloss of reputation is the most common reason people take their own lives. This\nis also true in modern nations such as Ghana, where one 32-year-old was\ndocumented drinking pesticide after villagers caught him having sex with a\nsheep. Accusations of sexual crimes against children are associated with\n‘drastically elevated’ rates of suicide: one survey found [53 per cent of\nAmericans saying they’d prefer instant\ndeath](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos720785) than the reputation of a\nchild molester; 70 per cent opted for the amputation of their dominant hand\nover a swastika tattoo on their face; 40 per cent preferred a year in jail to\nthe reputation of a criminal.\n\nIn each status game we play, we have a reputation. In its details, that\nreputation will be different within the mind of every player. We exist in\nvarying degrees of depth and varying degrees of fairness in all these minds.\nWhenever others think of us, they’ll overwrite us with their own status\ninformation. Are we moral or immoral? Expert or useless? How do we look? How\ndo we talk? What job do we do? Do we make them feel loved or hated? Fancied or\nrepulsed?",

Why do their\nadoring fans behave so giddily and embarrassingly in their presence? Why do\nthey begin copying how they dress, how they talk and what they read?\n\n[Whenever a person shows they’re valuable to their game, by being\nconspicuously virtuous or successful, it’s\nregistered](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos721422) by their co-players.\nSubconsciously, they’ll see this person’s winning behaviour as a chance to win\nthemselves.

As a reward for\nall their valuable time and knowledge, they offer them symbolic status: they\nlavish them with eye contact and defer to them in conversation; they might\n[maintain a hunched, subservient\nposture](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos721824); bare their teeth in\nsubmissive displays known as ‘[fear grimaces’ in apes and\n‘smiles’](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos722235) in humans; fetch them\nfood, drink or other gifts; walk behind them; hold doors open; seat them in a\nspecial location or use honorific titles to address them. The prestigious\nplayer will luxuriate in these signals of status. These people clearly think\nthey’re marvellous. But as lovely as it feels, it’s often a trick, a strategy,\na game plan.\n\nThese game-playing instincts are a component of our universal human nature. In\ntheir hot desire to learn from prestigious players, people often copy them\nblindly: dressing like them, eating what they eat, talking as they talk,\nreading books they recommend, absorbing their beliefs, behaviours and\nmannerisms. These lower-ranked players can come to seem virtually possessed.\nThe circuitry that’s driving them has been present for millions of years:\n[monkeys also copy high-status\nassociates](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos722791). But our evolutionary\ncousins don’t take the copying instinct anywhere near as far as we do.\n[Studies comparing infant humans to\nchimpanzees](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos723316) show both species\ncopy a prestigious individual’s actions, such as when they skilfully retrieve\na treat with a stick – but only humans copy all the actions.

Mimicking the actions of high-status people is so desirable, it’s\nargued, their brains reinterpret the pain signals as pleasurable. Children are\nthought to teach themselves to enjoy spice-burning foods using automatic\nprestige-driven imitation. They rarely have to be forced.\n\nMuch of our mimicking behaviour is subconscious. We don’t realise we’re doing\nit, or why. But how do we choose who to copy? How do we identify potentially\nuseful co-players? We’re born with a natural ability to seek them out. We\nunconsciously scan our game for various ‘cues’ that someone’s worth learning\nfrom. And it begins early. Professor Joseph Henrich, a world expert in the\npsychology of status, writes that, [‘by age one\ninfants](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos724195) use their own early\ncultural knowledge to figure out who tends to know things, and then use this\ninformation to focus learning, attention and memory’.\n\nThe brain is coded to seek four main cues that, once detected, trigger their\nfocus. Firstly, we look for [the self-similarity\ncue](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos724460). We make the assumption we’re\nmost likely to learn useful lessons from people like us. We have an inbuilt\npreference for those who match our age, race and gender. We attend to them,\nand thus offer them status, preferentially. This is a deep source of much of\nthe cliquishness and prejudice that pollutes so many status games. Sadly, it\nseems automatic. Even very young infants defer to strangers who share their\nmother’s dialect.\n\nNext we look for [‘skill cues](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos724775)’.\nWho, in our game, seems particularly able? Research suggests we start\nmimicking people who display competence at tasks at around 14 months. We also\nseek out ‘success cues’ – status symbols such as an experienced hunter’s\nnecklace of teeth; a tribal chief’s larger hut; a PhD; a pair of Manolo\nBlahnik’s Lurums. Our desire to signal success in this way is the cause of the\n‘conspicuous consumption’ that occurs across the world. [The global luxury\nmarket is worth around](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos725032) $1.2\ntrillion per year, with $285 billion being spent on goods, much of it in Asia.\n[Members of the Amazonian](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos725284)\nTsimane’ tribe who earn more money than others burn up a greater percentage of\nit on flashy goods such as watches; over in the West, if you want to, you can\nbuy a Franck Muller Aeternitas Mega 4 watch for $2.7 million.\n\nFinally, [we look for ‘prestige\ncues](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos725664)’: we analyse the body\nlanguage, eye movements and voice patterns of our co-players to see who\nthey’re deferring to. We detect similar clues in the behaviour of prestigious\npeople themselves. Then, we start paying attention to them. These processes\nare potent and ancient and designed to operate in small groups, not the\ncolossal modern environment of global media and internet. Today it’s not\nuncommon for millions to pay attention to one person simply because millions\nof others are paying attention to them and for this to become a feedback loop,\nsending a relatively unremarkable individual into the distant upper reaches of\nplanetary status.

[Academics call\nthis](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos725936) ‘The Paris Hilton Effect’.\n\nAnyone who fancies changing the world would be well advised to study the power\nof these cues to influence human behaviour. The subconscious copy-flatter-\nconform behaviours they trigger can be extraordinarily effecting. The [English\nexplorer Captain James Cook](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos726227) used\nprestige cues to compel his men to eat the sauerkraut that was an experimental\nremedy for scurvy, the disease known as ‘the plague of the Sea, and the Spoyle\nof Mariners’ that was responsible for roughly two million deaths of sailors\nbetween 1500 and 1800. In 1769, Cook set sail for the South Pacific with 7,860\npounds of the pungent fermented cabbage on board and ordered it be served only\nat the ‘Cabbin Table’ and not to the crew. This was a prestige cue. [‘The\nmoment they see their superiors](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos726892)\nset a value upon it, it becomes the finest stuff in the world,’ Cook noted in\nhis journal. Sure enough, the lower ranked players began requesting it. Before\nlong, sauerkraut had to be rationed. The number of men that died from scurvy\non that expedition was a record-breaking zero.\n\nPrestige cues haven’t only improved the diets of sailors. For generations,\nBritain had the justifiable reputation of having some of the worst food in\nEurope and perhaps the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, many of its highest-\nstatus chefs were actually French (when Albert Roux arrived in England in the\n1950s olive oil was for sale only in chemists as a treatment for ear wax)\nwhilst its TV cookery stars – Delia Smith, Madhur Jaffrey, Keith Floyd – were\nnot especially statusful, embodying the middle-aged homeliness of Sunday\nafternoon in the cul-de-sac. That changed in January 1987 when a working-class\nchef from Leeds began leading the kitchen at a new restaurant, Harvey’s, in\nsouth London. Marco Pierre White won his first Michelin star within a year and\nhis second the next. The 25-year-old quickly became famous.\n\nNot only was White astonishingly talented, he was beautiful, charismatic and\ndangerous, developing a reputation for passionate fury both in the kitchen and\non the restaurant floor, where he’d sometimes eject diners. In 1988 a TV\nseries, Marco, was made about him and, in 1990, White Heat was published. A\nluxurious book of black and white photographs taken at Harvey’s, it showed\nWhite as a rock star, posing topless, smoking, cleaver slashing, dark curls\ntumbling to his shoulders. In and out of the world of chefs, it was a\nsensation. ‘I don’t know [if I can adequately convey to\nyou](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos727358) the impact that White Heat\nhad on me, on the chefs and cooks around me, on subsequent generations,’ wrote\nthe New York chef-author Anthony Bourdain. ‘Suddenly, there was life pre-\nMarco, and post-Marco … This book gave us power. It all started here.’\n\nWhite became the youngest chef in history to win three Michelin stars. Finally\nBritain could take some pride in the culinary scene that had long been a\nsource of international shame. Members of the elite filled the icon’s tables\nand they put him in their newspapers and on their television channels. A\nnation’s prestige cognition began twitching as fine dining became a\nsignificant symbol of status.",

Members of the elite filled the icon’s tables\nand they put him in their newspapers and on their television channels. A\nnation’s prestige cognition began twitching as fine dining became a\nsignificant symbol of status. White also helped make food-work itself\nstatusful: a new generation of Britons saw the chef game as one that could\noffer major prestige – and there was now an emerging market waiting for them.\n\nOn his way up, White played the status game with intensity. ‘[Marco only came\nto steal my recipes](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos727636),’ wrote Chef\nPierre Koffmann, at whose London restaurant, La Tante Claire, he’d trained.\n‘But he’s one of the best chefs I ever had in my kitchen – always looking,\nalways listening, wanting to absorb as much as possible as quickly as\npossible.’ But when White himself became prestigious, he paid it back and\nmore. Working under him in the tiny kitchen at Harvey’s were several young\nchefs who’d earn their own Michelin stars in Britain, not least a boyish\nGordon [Ramsay, who White would describe\nas](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos727927), ‘One of the most competitive\npeople I’ve ever met in my life … Gordon wants to catch more fish than Marco,\nGordon wants to catch a bigger fish than Marco.’ In many ways a mini-Marco,\nRamsay would earn sixteen stars at various restaurants and train much of the\nnext century’s elite: Clare Smyth, Angela Hartnett, Mark Sargeant, Marcus\nWareing, Jason Atherton and more.\n\nMarco Pierre White was a one-man status generating machine. The awards, the\nfame, the beauty, the TV series, the book: these were prestige cues,\nsignalling major success-based status. They triggered a generation and helped\nchange a culture. Excellent food became a status symbol, and this value spread\nthrough cities, towns, farms and farm shops, specialist retailers and\nsupermarkets. It was expressed on television, in magazines, newspapers and,\neventually, on social media. Of course, other factors were also critical, not\nleast a healthy economy, and White was undoubtedly not the only gale behind\nthe wave. But his contribution to Britain finding its culinary pride was\nenormous. This is how cultures often progress. At the core of the process is\nour individual tendency to mimic prestigious people in the hope that we’ll\nbecome prestigious ourselves.\n\nIt works the opposite way too. If people we consider significantly beneath us\nbegin copying us, we’re likely to drop the behaviours that earned us status in\nthe first place. When the fashion brand [Burberry’s signature check design was\nadopted](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos728214) by football fans and\nworking-class celebrities, who displayed it on bikinis, umbrellas and prams,\nthey felt it necessary to claw back numerous licensing deals in order to\nstaunch the carotid bleed of upper-class customers.

[Hundreds of thousands lost\ntheir](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos729305) lives to these contests\nthat were often triggered by the pettiest of status slights. A typical\nduellist would ‘prefer to die by a bullet or stab wound than allow\nunfavourable ideas about him to remain lodged in the mind’, writes Alain de\nBotton, who records a man in Paris being killed after describing his rival’s\napartment as ‘tasteless’, a man in Florence dying after accusing his cousin of\n‘not understanding Dante’ and a duel over possession of an Angora cat.\n\nDuelling was widespread for hundreds of years. In the eighteenth century David\nHume complained it had ‘[shed much of the best blood in\nChristendom](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos729600)’. It’s argued that\none reason [it fell from fashion](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos729928)\nin the early 1800s was its being copied by the lower orders, leading the upper\nclasses to abandon it. This signalled it was no longer prestigious, and so\neveryone gave up. One contemporary British parliamentarian described the\nprocess: ‘[I remember that some](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos730233)\nlinen-drapers’ assistants took it into their heads to go down one Sunday\nmorning … and they began fighting duels; and that as soon as the linen-\ndrapers’ assistants took to duelling, it became very infamous in the eyes of\nthe upper classes … Now nothing would be so ridiculous as any nobleman or\ngentleman thinking of resenting an insult by going out and fighting a duel\nabout it.’\n\nMore recently, the [eating of shark fin soup has declined significantly in\nChina](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos730538), due in large part to a\nsuccessful programme of prestige-signalling. The largely tasteless and\nnutrition-free dish was known as an elite delicacy in Imperial China, and was\neagerly copied in the new economy, where the monied elite used it as a status\nsignaller at weddings and banquets. Around seventy-three million sharks were\nkilled for soup every year. A public information campaign was launched, headed\nby prestigious celebrities including basketball star Yao Ming. Importantly,\nChina’s president removed the dish from all their official banquets. Between\n2011 and 2018 consumption in China fell by 80 per cent.\n\nEssential to the operation of these status dynamics is influence. When we\nidentify prestigious players our subconscious copy-flatter-conform programming\nis triggered and we allow them to alter our beliefs and behaviour. Status\ngames run on powerlines of influence and deference that crackle up and down\ntheir hierarchy. This is why, of all the countless status symbols that exist\nin human life, influence is probably the most reliable. We often assume money\nor fancy possessions are the most certain symbols of a person’s rank, but the\nhighest-status monk in the world may have less wealth, and fewer Hermès ties,\nthan the most junior banker on Wall Street. Influence is different.\n\nOf course, it’s not a perfect signal of status; someone low-ranking could\ninfluence others with gossip, flattery or lies. But it is an immediate and\npredictable result of it. Even in small-scale societies, a person’s status is\ncommonly expressed in their capacity to influence: they [‘tend to be more\nprominent in group discussions](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos730914),\nto make their opinions known and their suggestions clear, and to articulate\nthe consensus once it is determined’. The outsized influence that high-status\nplayers exert can also be measured in how much they talk.

Wherever you track trails of influence – of people deferring,\naltering their beliefs or behaviour to match those of the people above them –\nyou’ll find status games being played and won. We frequently measure our own\nlevel of status by our capacity to influence. Our status detection systems\nmonitor the extent to which others defer to us in the subtlest negotiations of\nbehaviour, body language and tone.\n\nThis is one reason we can take it so personally when our ideas, tastes or\nopinions are rejected. If human life was strictly rational, we’d be likely to\nfeel blank when disagreed with, or perhaps worried a suboptimal decision was\nbeing made. We might even feel pleased about it, taking the disagreement as a\nsignal of the group’s rigour. But when our attempts at influence fail –\nespecially in public, especially in the witness of higher-status players – we\ncan become preoccupied, livid, bitter and vengeful. When this happens, we\noften slip into a more primitive mode of play in which status is not earned in\ndisplays of usefulness, but grabbed in acts of dominance.\n\n\n[7](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos4456)\n\n[Dominance Games ](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos4456)\n\n[EASTER SUNDAY 2018](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos731608), a routine\ntraffic stop in Tenafly, New Jersey. Police officers spotted an out-of-town\ncar that had part of its licence plate obscured as well as tinted side\nwindows, which were forbidden in the state. Having pulled the vehicle over,\nthe officers found three young adults, including a driver who failed to\nproduce valid insurance or registration. They impounded the car, ordering it\nto be collected when the correct documents could be produced. One of the\npassengers called her mother to arrange for her to come pick them up.\n\nThat’s when it all went weird.\n\n60 years old, narrow and imposing in tight black athleisure wear and a\nburgundy gilet, she strode in, pushed her sunglasses up onto her forehead and,\nwith an outstretched hand and a business card, announced, ‘I’m Caren Turner.’\n\n‘That’s fine,’ said the first police officer, glancing at her card. ‘I don’t\nneed that.’\n\n‘Ok fine. I’m Caren Turner,’ she said again.\n\n‘You’re just here as a ride, right?’\n\n‘No I’m not. I’m here as a concerned citizen. And a friend of the mayor. And\nI’ve been in Tenafly for twenty-five years and I take full responsibility for\nthem. What was the reason they were pulled over?’\n\n‘The driver has all the information. He’ll tell you.’\n\n‘No-no-no-no-no,’ she said, the no’s coming at him like little nubby bullets.\n‘I need to know.’\n\n‘No, you don’t need to know. You’re not involved here. You’re picking them\nup.’\n\n‘No-no-no, I’m involved. Trust me. I’m very involved.’\n\nDuring the encounter, which was captured on a police dash-cam, Turner\nrepeatedly attempted to get the officers to tell her why they’d pulled the car\nover.

It failed when she told them\nthe passengers included people ‘attending Yale graduate school, a PhD\nstudent’. It failed when she repeated her demand: ‘I need to know.’ The second\nofficer explained his refusal to give her what she wanted: ‘It’s more of the\nway you approached me and your demeanour.’ As Turner became more aggravated,\nshe began holding her arms away from her body, gesticulating with a jabbing\nfinger and standing closer to the second officer – and closer and closer,\npinning him against his car. ‘Step back,’ she was told. ‘Take a step back from\nme. I can’t move back any further.’\n\nAbout seven minutes into the encounter, she berated the men. ‘I’m very\ndisappointed in the way you two are acting.’ When the second officer suggested\nshe take the youngsters home she placed her hand on her hip and scolded him,\n‘That’s pathetic. And you are a disappointment.’ She turned to the other\nofficer. ‘And you’re just following him. So you’re also a disappointment.’\n\n‘You may take them now,’ said officer two.\n\n‘You may not Tell. Me. When. To. Take. My. Child,’ she said, her head pecking\nside to side with each staccato syllable. ‘You may shut the fuck up and not\ntell me when I may take my kid and her friends, who are PhD students from MIT\nand Yale. You may tell me nothing because you’ve told me nothing. Shame on\nboth of you. I will be talking to the chief of police and I will be speaking\nto the mayor … I’ve got all your details, sweetheart.’ Eventually Turner left.\nThen she came back. When one officer admitted he was ‘a little disappointed’\nin her she snapped back, ‘You don’t get to be disappointed in me.’ She told\nthem, ‘The police have all been in my home and my second home and in the third\nhome in Tenafly.’\n\n‘I don’t see how that’s relevant to this situation,’ said officer one.\n\nThe video found its way online and into the media. A week later, [Turner\nresigned her position at](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos731878) the Port\nAuthority of New York and New Jersey, where she’d also been chair of the\nethics committee. In a statement she regretted letting ‘my emotions get the\nbetter of me’ and her ‘off-colour language’. But she denied using her position\nto seek special treatment and finished with this delicious flourish: ‘I\nencourage the Tenafly Police Department to review best practices with respect\nto tone and de-escalation, so that incidents like this do not recur.’\n\nWhat happened, on that bright Saturday afternoon in March, was an argument\nabout a question. Caren Turner wanted to know why her daughter and friends had\nbeen pulled over. The officers requested she ask the driver, who was standing\nperhaps three metres away and in possession of all the answers.",

    "chunk_full": "A week later, [Turner\nresigned her position at](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos731878) the Port\nAuthority of New York and New Jersey, where she’d also been chair of the\nethics committee. In a statement she regretted letting ‘my emotions get the\nbetter of me’ and her ‘off-colour language’. But she denied using her position\nto seek special treatment and finished with this delicious flourish: ‘I\nencourage the Tenafly Police Department to review best practices with respect\nto tone and de-escalation, so that incidents like this do not recur.’\n\nWhat happened, on that bright Saturday afternoon in March, was an argument\nabout a question. Caren Turner wanted to know why her daughter and friends had\nbeen pulled over. The officers requested she ask the driver, who was standing\nperhaps three metres away and in possession of all the answers. Beneath the\nsurface (not far beneath the surface; less than a half a millimetre beneath\nthe surface) this was a status battle, a dispute over who had superior rank.\nCaren Turner played a dominance game. She lost.\n\nWhenever our sense of status is challenged, like this, we can easily slip into\na different state of being. We employ primeval neural coding that was written\nmillions of years ago, in the prehuman era of dominance. Whilst the prestige\ngames of virtue and success have made us gentler and wiser animals, these\nsuperior modes of playing haven’t completely overwritten our bestial\ncapacities. As psychologist Professor Dan McAdams writes, [‘the human\nexpectation](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos732251) that social status\ncan be seized through brute force and intimidation, that the strongest and the\nbiggest and boldest will lord it over the rank and file, is very old,\nawesomely intuitive and deeply ingrained. Its younger rival – prestige – was\nnever able to dislodge dominance from the human mind.’\n\nThe beast is still in us. It is our second self. Many of us shade between\nthese states multiple times a day, often without realising we’re morphing from\none self into another. And they really are different modes of being. Prestige\nand dominance behaviours are [‘underpinned by\ndistinct](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos732628) psychological processes,\nbehaviours and neurochemistry which were selected for distinct evolutionary\npressures’. [We tend to hold](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos732900)\nourselves differently when inhabited by each version of us: when in a\ndominant, second-self mode we take up more space, hold our arms away from our\nbodies, smile less often and maintain a downwards head tilt; when in a\nprestigious state we embody our status in subtler ways, expanding our chest,\npushing our torso out, tilting our head upwards. [Studies show even\nchildren](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos733328) younger than 2 can\ndifferentiate between players using strategies of dominance and prestige.\n\nBoth work. Dominant and prestigious players alike [have more\ninfluence](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos733858) over co-players.\nDominant men, like prestigious men, [have greater reproductive\nsuccess](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos734119). One meta-analysis of\nover thirty studies found dominance to be one of the ‘most robust predictors\nof leader emergence, outperforming myriad others including conscientiousness\nand intelligence’. This is despite the fact that dominant-style leaders are\nusually [less effective than](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos734719) the\nprestigious, being more likely to put their [own interests before\nthe](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos735017) group, [less likely to\nseek](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos735311) advice and tending to\nrespond to criticism with ‘ego defensive aggression’. They’re also\n[overbearing, like to publicly](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos735637)\ncredit themselves with the success of the group, tease and humiliate\nsubordinates and are manipulative, compared to prestigious leaders who are\nmore likely to be self-deprecating, tell jokes and publicly attribute success\nto the team. Tellingly, we’re especially prone to raising up dominant leaders\nwhen the status of our game is under threat.",

Tellingly, we’re especially prone to raising up dominant leaders\nwhen the status of our game is under threat. In studies, [men and women\nhave](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos735949) picked silhouettes of tall,\nbulky people with thin eyes and lips and a strong jawline as ideal leaders in\ntimes of war; in peacetime those with narrower frames were more popular.\n\nThe critical difference between dominance and prestige is that we don’t give\nstatus freely to second-self players. Typically, dominant players take it from\nus. Psychologists describe dominance strategy as [entailing the\n‘induction](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos736333) of fear, through\nintimidation and coercion, to attain or maintain rank and influence’. They\nforce deference from co-players by inducing ‘fear of their ability to inflict\nphysical or psychological harm’ using ‘acts of aggression, coercion, threats,\nderogation, debasement, and manipulation’. Second-self players can use\nviolence and the fear of it to claw their way up the rankings, then, but they\ncan also exploit varieties of pain that are marked not by blood and bruises,\nbut by tears, shame and despair.\n\nThese modes of dominance are [one of the\nmost](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos734416) easily observable\ndifferences between men and women. It’s not unusual for either sex to act with\nhostility in defence of their status. Almost half of males and females, in one\nstudy, gave [‘status/reputation\nconcerns](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos736639)’ as the primary cause of\ntheir most recent act of aggression. But still, today, men have a propensity\nfor physical status contests built into their minds, muscles and bones.\nThey’re overwhelmingly the perpetrators of murder, and comprise most of their\nvictims, with [around 90 per cent](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos737212)\nof global homicides being committed by males, and 70 per cent being their\ntargets. In the majority of cases, killers are [unemployed, unmarried, poorly\neducated](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos737573) and under 30. Their\nsense of status is fragile. In most places, the leading reasons given for\nkilling are ‘status-driven’, writes conflict researcher Dr Mike Martin, ‘the\nresult of altercations over trivial disputes’.\n\nProfessor James Gilligan, who’s spent more than three decades using prisons\nand prison hospitals as ‘laboratories’ to study the causes of criminal\nviolence, finds that [‘time after\ntime](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos737867)’ men give the same answer as\nto why they assault or kill: ‘“because he disrespected me” or “he disrespected\nmy visitor [or wife, mother, sister, girlfriend, daughter, etc.].” In fact,\nthey used that phrase so often that they abbreviated it into the slang phrase,\n“He dis’ed me.” Whenever people use a word so often that they abbreviate it,\nit is clearly central to their moral and emotional vocabulary.’ Gilligan once\nbelieved muggings and armed robberies to be motivated primarily by greed or\nneed. ‘But when I actually sat down and spoke at length with men who had\nrepeatedly committed such crimes, I would start to hear comments like “I never\ngot so much respect before in my life as I did when I pointed a gun at some\ndude’s face.”’\n\nThe causes of female violence are little different.",

One study into [working-\nclass 16-year](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos738165)-olds in Britain\nfound theirs was commonly triggered by insults, often to do with intelligence,\ndelinquency or sexual behaviour. But serious violence among women and girls is\ncomparatively rare. For psychologist Professor Jonathan Haidt, [‘girls and\nboys](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos738451) are equally aggressive but\ntheir aggression is different. Boys’ aggression revolves around the threat of\nviolence: “I will physically hurt you” … but girls’ aggression has always been\nrelational: “I will destroy your reputation or your relationships”.’\nResearchers argue female aggression tends to be ‘indirect’. Rather than\nassault an antagonist’s physical body, face-to-face, they’ll attack their\navatar. They’ll attempt to secure their enemy’s ostracization, severing their\nconnections to games, and use mockery, gossip and insult to strip them of\nstatus. Of course, these are average differences. Reputation-attacking\nstrategies are also widely exploited by men, although the nature of insults\ncan vary: one analysis of online conflict found [‘women derogate\nother](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos738826) women’s promiscuity and\nphysical attractiveness on social media more than men do, while men derogate\nmen on their abilities more than women do’. Likewise, plenty of women use\nface-to-face dominance, as our encounter with alpha female Caren Turner shows.\n\nDominance behaviour is more likely to be triggered when the relative status of\nthe protagonists is murky. If the hierarchy doesn’t clearly show who’s in\ncharge, there’s a greater temptation to use aggression to secure supremacy.\nDuring the traffic stop, Turner appeared to believe her position as Port\nAuthority Commissioner, attorney, friend of the mayor, associate of the Chief\nof Police, host of Yale and MIT PhD students and owner of three houses in\nTenafly clearly symbolised her superiority. But to the police officers she was\n‘just here as a ride’. This is true of purely verbal disputes and it’s true of\nthose that turn physical. For sociologist Professor Roger Gould, [‘the more\nambiguous](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos739239) the relation is with\nrespect to who should be expected to outrank whom, the more likely violence\nis’.\n\nThe disagreement between Turner and the officers was ostensibly about a\nquestion: ‘why did you pull them over?’ The question was reasonable. Their\nrefusal to answer was petty. But this is often the way with such disputes,\nincluding those that become so aggressive they end in murder. When people have\nan outburst over something trivial – an unanswered question, a tiny debt, a\nperceived lack of gratitude, a minor discourtesy on the road – they often\njustify themselves by saying it’s about the ‘principle’ of the matter. For\nGould, [those who talk of](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos739498)\nprinciple mean ‘the other party has arrogated to himself or herself a dominant\nrole that has not previously characterised the relation’. In life, even the\nsubtlest interpersonal events can be symbolic. They’re all too easily read by\nthe status detection system as ‘fuck you’.\n\nWhen this happens, we’re often guilty of forcing our way back on top with\naggression or the threat of it. This sits uncomfortably with the image we tend\nto prefer of ourselves as a moral hero. So we deny our behaviour. We tell a\nstory that blames circumstance or the devil or our villainous antagonists:\nthose dreadful officers with their triggering tone and failure to de-escalate.\nThese brain-spun visions blind us to the full reality of who we are.

[‘She got\nvery](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos739862) angry,’ he recounted later.\n‘She cursed at me and pushed me.’ He froze, shocked, completely lost as to how\nto respond. Everybody was watching. ‘Are you okay?’ asked one of his friends.\nElliot couldn’t speak or move. He felt humiliated. He barely talked for the\nrest of the day. ‘I couldn’t believe what had happened.’ The experience made\nhim feel like an ‘insignificant, unworthy little mouse. I felt so small and\nvulnerable. I couldn’t believe this girl was so horrible to me, and I thought\nit was because she viewed me as a loser.’ As he grew into his teens,\ncontinually rejected and bullied by the cool school elites, Elliot never\nforgot the incident. ‘It would scar me for life.’\n\n[Ted was a gifted](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos740321) scholar,\narriving at Harvard University at age 16. One day, he applied to take part in\nan experiment led by the prestigious psychologist Professor Henry Murray. Ted\nwas instructed to spend a month writing an ‘exposition of your personal\nphilosophy of life, an affirmation of the major guiding principles in accord\nwith which you live or hope to live’ and an autobiography containing deeply\npersonal information about subjects including toilet training, thumb sucking\nand masturbation. What Ted didn’t know was that Murray had a history working\non behalf of secretive government agencies. This would be a study of harsh\ninterrogation techniques, [specifically the\n‘effects](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos740688) of emotional and\npsychological trauma on unwitting human subjects’. Once he’d detailed his\nsecrets and philosophies, Ted was led into a brightly lit room, had wires and\nprobes attached to him, and was sat in front of a one-way mirror. There began\na series of what Murray called ‘vehement, sweeping, and personally abusive’\nattacks on his personal history and the rules and symbols by which he lived\nand hoped to live. [‘Every week\nfor](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos740982) three years, someone met with\nhim to verbally abuse him and humiliate him,’ Ted’s brother said. ‘He never\ntold us about the experiments, but we noticed how he changed.’ Ted himself\ndescribed the humiliation experiments as [‘the worst\nexperience](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos741214) of my life’.\n\nEd grew up with an abusive mother.

This ‘hassle’ with his\nmother made him feel ‘very inadequate around women, because they posed a\nthreat to me. Inside I blew them up very large. You know, the little games\nwomen play, I couldn’t play [or] meet their demands. So I backslid.’\n\nEd backslid. He really did. He killed his grandmother, ‘because I wanted to\nkill my mother’. Then he killed his mother. He cut off her head and had sex\nwith it, then buried it in the garden, eyes facing upwards because [she always\nwanted people](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos742271) to ‘look up to\nher’. He also killed eight other women, having sex with some of their corpses\nand eating others. Ed Kemper remains one of America’s most notorious serial\nkillers. Elliot Rodger, meanwhile, became a spree killer, killing six young\npeople and then himself at the University of California, Santa Barbara, in\n2014. And Ted? That’s Ted Kaczynski. The Unabomber.\n\nIf life is a status game, what happens when all our status is taken from us?\nWhat happens when we’re made to feel like nothing, again and again and again?\nHumiliation can be seen as the opposite of status, the hell to its heaven.\nLike status, humiliation comes from other people. Like status, it involves\ntheir judgement of our place in the social rankings. Like status, the higher\nthey sit in the rankings, and the more of them there are, the more powerful\ntheir judgement. And, like status, it matters. Humiliation has been described\nby researchers as [‘the nuclear\nbomb](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos742530) of the emotions’ and has\nbeen shown to [cause major\ndepressions](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos742966), suicidal states,\npsychosis, extreme rage and severe anxiety, ‘including ones characteristic of\npost-traumatic stress disorder’. Criminal violence expert Professor James\nGilligan [describes the experience\nof](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos743400) humiliation as an\n‘annihilation of the self’. His decades of research in prisons and prison\nhospitals, seeking the causes of violence, led him to [‘a psychological\ntruth](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos743813) exemplified by the fact\nthat one after another of the most violent men I have worked with over the\nyears have described to me how they had been humiliated repeatedly throughout\ntheir childhoods’.\n\nThe logic of the status game dictates that humiliation (and to a lesser degree\nshame, which can be seen as the private experience of humiliation, the sense\nof being judged appalling by the imaginary audience in our heads) must be\nuniquely catastrophic. For psychologists Professor Raymond Bergner and Dr\nWalter Torres [humiliation is an\nabsolute](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos744134) purging of status and\nthe ability to claim it. They propose four preconditions for an episode to\ncount as humiliating. Firstly, we should believe, as most of us do, that we’re\ndeserving of status. Secondly, humiliating incidents are public. Thirdly, the\nperson doing the degrading must themselves have some modicum of status. And\nfinally, the stinger: the ‘rejection of the status to claim status’.

Thirdly, the\nperson doing the degrading must themselves have some modicum of status. And\nfinally, the stinger: the ‘rejection of the status to claim status’. Or, from\nour perspective, rejection from the status game entirely.\n\nIn severe states of humiliation, we tumble so spectacularly down the rankings\nthat we’re no longer considered a useful co-player. So we’re gone, exiled,\ncancelled. Connection to our kin is severed. ‘The critical nature of this\nelement is hard to overstate,’ they write. ‘When humiliation annuls the status\nof individuals to claim status, they are in essence denied eligibility to\nrecover the status they have lost.’ If humans are players, programmed to seek\nconnection and status, humiliation insults both our deepest needs. And there’s\nnothing we can do about it. ‘They have effectively lost the voice to make\nclaims within the relevant community and especially to make counterclaims on\ntheir own behalf to remove their humiliation.’ The only way to recover is to\nfind a new game even if that means rebuilding an entire life and self. ‘Many\nhumiliated individuals find it necessary to move to another community to\nrecover their status, or more broadly, to reconstruct their lives.’\n\nBut there is one other option. An African proverb says, ‘the child who is not\nembraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth’. If the game\nrejects you, you can return in dominance as a vengeful God, using deadly\nviolence to force the game to attend to you in humility. The life’s work of\nProfessor Gilligan led him to conclude the fundamental cause of most human\nviolence is [the ‘wish to](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos744515) ward\noff or eliminate the feeling of shame and humiliation and replace it with its\nopposite, the feeling of pride’.\n\nOf course, it would be naive to claim Ed, Ted and Elliot were triggered solely\nas a response to humiliation. If the cauterisation of status was a simple\nmass-killing switch, such crimes would be common. Various further contributory\nfactors are possible. All three were men, which dramatically increases the\nlikelihood they’d seek to restore their lost status with violence. [Elliot\nRodger was said](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos744801) to be on the\nautism spectrum, which might’ve impacted his ability to make friends and\ngirlfriends; a court psychiatrist claimed [Ed Kemper had\nparanoid](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos745065) schizophrenia (although\nthis remains contested); and Kaczynski’s brother said Ted once [‘showed\nindications of](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos745338) schizophrenia’.\nBut none of these conditions are answers in themselves, because the vast\nmajority of those that have them don’t burn down their villages.\n\nAnd that’s what happened. All three attacked the status games from which they\nfelt rejected, asserting their dominance over their degraders. Ed Kemper’s\nmother would taunt her son with her belief that the high-status co-ed girls at\nher university would never date him. He began killing those girls, becoming\nthe ‘Co-Ed Killer’, before finishing with his mother: [‘I cut\noff](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos745558) her head and I humiliated her\ncorpse.’ He then pushed her voice box into the food disposal unit. ‘It [seemed\nappropriate as](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos745817) much as she’d\nbitched and screamed and yelled at me over so many years.’ Kemper’s\npsychological profiler at the FBI, John Douglas, writes: [‘He was\na](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos746071) man on a mission who’d had\nhumiliating experiences with women and was now out to punish as many as he\ncould,’ adding he was [‘someone not\nborn](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos746313) a serial killer but\nmanufactured as one’.",

His bombing campaign was the start of\na revolution, aimed at freeing the masses from slavery by ‘the system’. He\nsought and received, in return for a promissory cessation of violence, the\nextraordinarily statusful experience of having his 35,000-word exposition on\nmodernity’s evils published by the Washington Post.\n\nAnd Elliot Rodger? This is what he had to say in the novel-length\nautobiography he distributed prior to his spree: ‘All those popular kids who\nlive such lives of hedonistic pleasure while I’ve had to rot in loneliness all\nthese years. They all looked down upon me every time I tried to join them.\nThey’ve all treated me like a mouse … If humanity will not give me a worthy\nplace among them, then I will destroy them all.

He loved James Bond and bought himself a Walther PPK pistol, a\nshortwave radio and even opened a Swiss bank account. But Hanssen’s father was\nabusive, belittling him and inflicting strange punishments. ‘He forced him to\nsit with his legs spread in some fashion,’ his psychiatrist reported. ‘He was\nforced to sit in that position and it was humiliating.’ Such degradings also\nhappened outside the home. Whenever his best friend’s mother encountered his\nfather, there was ‘always something belittling about Bob. No matter what Bob\ndid, it wasn’t right. I’ve never seen a father like that. He would never have\na kind word to say about his only child.’ Even after Hanssen was grown and\nmarried, the degrading continued. When his parents came round for dinner, he’d\nbe too frightened to come downstairs. ‘He would get sick to his stomach and\ncould not face his father at the table. [His wife] Bonnie finally said, “If\nyou are under this roof, if you cannot be respectful to Bob, then you are not\nwelcome to come.”’\n\nBut Hanssen’s need for status was strong. He became an ‘ultra-religious,\ndevout, zealous’ member of the Catholic Church, a part of the elite group Opus\nDei that was the Pope’s personal prelature. He joined the FBI in 1976 where he\nhoped to live a life of statusful excitement as a counter-intelligence\noperative but was repeatedly turned down for such prestigious roles. According\nto his biographer, he kept finding himself in back rooms, ‘watching from afar\nas others performed more exciting work’. Hanssen was seen as ‘very, very\nsmart’ with strong technical skills, but he came off as superior and\ndifficult, carrying a ‘wry expression on his face. He just didn’t suffer fools\ngladly. Why should I have to reduce myself to this level?’ In 1979 Hanssen\ncontacted the Soviet Union and offered to spy for them. He wasn’t arrested\nuntil 2001, by which time he’d passed thousands of top-secret documents to the\nKGB and compromised many of their assets, some of whom were executed. Hanssen\nis considered the most damaging spy in US history. Following his trial his\npsychiatrist said, ‘If I had to pick one core psychological reason for his\nspying, I would target the experience he had in his relations with his\nfather.’\n\n[Humiliation is also a](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos748199) principal\ncause of honour killings. They involve a family conspiring to murder someone\nthey believe has brought humiliation upon their family by breaking the rules\nand symbols of their game, [usually with behaviours\nrelated](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos748460) to sexuality or being\n‘too Western’.

The language of blame and forgiveness might be suitable\nfor courts, churches and those directly affected, but by allowing moral talk\nto arrest our thinking, we become less useful; less able to identify risks and\npreventatives.\n\nIn 2014, in the aftermath of Elliot Rodger’s killing of four men and two women\nand his injuring of fourteen others, people began looking for the cause of his\nbarbarity. What demonic power could’ve derailed Rodger’s journey of life with\nsuch force? Commentators from Glenn Beck on the right to Vice magazine on the\nleft soon identified his obsession with the computer game World of Warcraft.\n[‘Please listen to](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos749990) me, you’ve got\nto get the video games out of your child’s hand,’ said Beck. ‘They cannot\nhandle it. This is not the same as Pac-Man. These are virtual worlds where\nthey live.’ Similarly, [Vice pointed\nto](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos750338) ‘the addictive cycle of\ngaming’ that takes players ‘ever further away from nurturing human contact,\nlove, and social ambition’. But there’s a problem with these stories, evident\nin Rodger’s 108,000-word autobiography.\n\nMy Twisted World: The Story of Elliot Rodger is an extraordinary document.\nGripping and appalling, it recounts in bracing detail his descent from\n‘blissful’ early childhood to a young adulthood of rejection, hatred and\nhomicidal madness. His grandiose need for status is present from the start: we\nlearn his father hails ‘from the prestigious Rodger family’ whilst his mother\nwas ‘friends with very important individuals from the film industry, including\nGeorge Lucas and Steven Spielberg’. Life was essentially happy, aside from his\nparents’ divorce, up until he realised he was becoming shorter and weaker than\nhis classmates. ‘This vexed me no end.’\n\nThe ages between 9 and 13 were Rodger’s ‘last period of contentment’. In his\nsocial life he began to notice ‘there were hierarchies, that some people were\nbetter than others … At school, there were always the “cool kids” who seemed\nto be more admirable than everyone else.’ He realised he ‘wasn’t cool at all.\nI had a dorky hairstyle. I wore plain and uncool clothing, and I was shy and\nunpopular … on top of this was the feeling that I was different because I am\nof mixed race.’ Following this realisation, nothing would be the same.",

I wore plain and uncool clothing, and I was shy and\nunpopular … on top of this was the feeling that I was different because I am\nof mixed race.’ Following this realisation, nothing would be the same. ‘The\npeaceful and innocent environment of childhood where everyone had an equal\nfooting was all over. The time of fair play was at its end.’\n\nAs a boy, he’d practised being ‘cool’ by learning to skateboard. Now he was\nolder, the rules had changed: ‘The “cool” thing to do now was to be popular\nwith girls. How in the blazes was I going to do that?’ Rodger found himself\nshunned and bullied. ‘I was extremely unpopular, widely disliked and viewed as\nthe weirdest kid.’ But he found succour in the online computer games he’d meet\nwith others to play, sometimes hanging out at an internet cafe until 3 a.m.:\n‘I was having so much fun outside of school with my friends at Planet Cyber\nthat I didn’t really care about getting popular or getting attention from\ngirls.’ When he discovered World of Warcraft, a game that allows players to\nteam up online and pursue missions, ‘it really blew my mind. My first\nexperience with WoW was like stepping into another world of excitement and\nadventure … it was like living another life.’ It became an obsession. ‘I hid\nmyself away in the online World of Warcraft, a place where I felt comfortable\nand secure.’\n\nMeanwhile the budding of his sex drive was proving hellish. Terrified of\nfemales and yet desirous of their approval, Rodger’s teenage years were spent\nin rejected, dumbfounded agony. He begged his parents not to send him to a\nmixed gender school. His peers mocked him, threw food at him and stole his\nbelongings. He spent every possible moment in World of Warcraft, achieving the\nextraordinary status of its highest level, a ‘huge and important\naccomplishment’. The three local boys with whom he’d play online were ‘the\nclosest thing I had to a group of friends’. But then Rodger made a grievous\ndiscovery. Those friends would often meet up in secret so they could play\nwithout him. ‘Even in World of Warcraft, I was an outcast, alone and\nunwanted.’ He began to feel ‘lonely even while playing’. He’d break down in\ntears in the middle of games. ‘I began to ask myself what the point was in\nplaying it.’ So he stopped.\n\nAnd then something switched. Up until this point, Rodger had presented as\nconfused, miserable and bitter. He was also hateful: his fear of women had\ncurdled into a powerful misogyny, his loathing extending to the ‘cool’ men\nthey chose to date. But angry misogynists, sadly, aren’t rare. Only when his\nsource of connection and status was lost did absolute pandemonium let loose in\nhis thoughts. ‘I began to have fantasies of becoming very powerful and\nstopping everyone from having sex,’ he wrote. ‘This was a major turning\npoint.’ On his final day of playing World of Warcraft, he described to his\nlast remaining friend his ‘newfound views’ that ‘sex must be abolished’.\n\nRodger’s brain had taken his feelings of debasement and resentment and\nmagicked them into a story in which he was the hero. It said his suffering was\nthe fault of women, who ‘represent everything that is unfair with this world’\nand who ‘control which men get [sex] and which men don’t’. By always choosing\n‘the stupid, degenerate, obnoxious men’, they were going to ‘hinder the\nadvancement of the human race’. He dreamed up an ‘ultimate and perfect\nideology of how a fair and pure world would work’. Sex would be outlawed.\nWomen would be destroyed, with some remaining to procreate via artificial\ninsemination.",

He took these hideous visions to be evidence of his superiority.\n‘I see the world differently than anyone else. Because of all the injustices I\nwent through and the worldview I developed because of them, I must be destined\nfor greatness.’ In the brain-spun dream in which he’d become lost, his\nmisogyny was righteous. ‘All I ever wanted was to love women, and in turn to\nbe loved by them back. Their behaviour towards me has only earned my hatred,\nand rightfully so! I am the true victim in all of this. I am the good guy.’\n\nRodger was 17. For the next five years until his killing spree, besides\nsporadic returns, his online game-playing ceased. At the same time, his\nmisery, loathing and madness caught fire. World of Warcraft had been the only\nplace he’d felt of value. It was a status game and one he’d excelled at.

And while we’re at it,\nwhat’s the point of football? What’s the point of chess? What’s the point of\ncomputer games? All those hours wasted in bedrooms pressing clicky buttons.\nHow is that making you a better person? How is that moving you on in life’s\nheroic journey? Like Elliot Rodger – why did he become obsessed with World of\nWarcraft? Was it because he loved killing things? Was it because he was a\nmonster?\n\nWorld of Warcraft is a status generating machine. The game conjured for Rodger\nan alternative reality in which an avatar of his self could play. He built a\nlife in there. He played games of dominance and success. He thrived. This is\nhow all the games people play for fun function: by exploiting the neural\ncircuitry that evolved to play the status game, which is the original game,\nand the greatest game of all. Athletes, boxers, swimmers, players of\nbasketball, chess and football and participants in reality TV competitions\ncompete for status in imagined worlds of rules and symbols. Solitary games,\nsuch as crosswords, are played before the imaginary audience that live in our\nheads, our conscience groaning and cheering as we fail or succeed.\n\nTo amplify their excitement, the games we make for pleasure have clever tweaks\nmade to their rules.

And our position, as it shifts from minute to minute, day to day, is\nneither fixed in a precisely defined rank nor declared publicly. Instead, it’s\nsensed. The status detection system reads it from clues in the world of\nsymbols we’re immersed in. This means it’s possible to attend a work meeting\nas a relatively low-ranked team member, contribute a fantastically useful\nidea, receive symbolic rewards of attention, praise and influence, and leave\nfeeling on top of the world. We might not be number one, but we feel like we\nare. Even though we have a job title and a pay grade, these don’t represent a\nprecise and inarguable judgement, like the position on a sports arena’s\nscoreboard. If business meetings were like this, with numbered rankings of in-\nmeeting performance announced at the end, in bright lights for everyone to see\n– well, you can imagine.\n\nNaturally occurring status games don’t require such tweaks to function. We can\nbe motivated, and urged into greater feats, by symbolic rewards from co-\nplayers, our promotion to higher ranks being valued more as a recognition of\nour worth than as a signal we’ve vanquished many enemies. These positive\nfeelings from the group are key: [in team tugs\nof](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos750688) war, when individual\nperformance is hidden, people pull about half as hard as when working alone,\nbut ramp up their efforts when a crowd cheers them on. The same is true of\nrunners and cyclists who also perform better with an appreciative audience.\n\nHealthy status games are also relatively small. In the Stone Age, the [tribal\nsubgroups in which](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos750952) we spent most\nof our time numbered perhaps twenty-five to thirty people, many of them\nextended family members. As we’ve learned, there would’ve been divisions even\nwithin those: men would’ve largely competed for status with other men, and\nwomen with women. Within the gender divide there’d have been further divisions\nby age and specialist arenas of competence: tracker, healer, storyteller,\nhoney-finder. This is why everyone in the world doesn’t feel as if they’re\nstriving for status against everyone else in the world. If, tomorrow morning,\nall seven billion of us decided we were personally competing with Michelle\nObama or the King of Thailand, we’d likely suffer a global nervous breakdown.\nResearchers find [happiness isn’t](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos751184)\nclosely linked to our socioeconomic status, which captures our rank compared\nwith others across the whole of society, including class. It’s actually our\nsmaller games that matter: ‘studies show that respect and admiration within\none’s local group, but not socioeconomic status, predicts subjective well-\nbeing’.\n\nOur natural propensity to play small, local games is found in combat units\nduring war, in which soldiers tend to be motivated less by the distant aims of\ntheir national leader than their desire for connection and respect from their\nbrothers-in-arms and the primal thrill of dominance play.

Research on this matter is mixed, but [moderate levels are\nthought](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos752624) to increase diligence and\nproductivity. Too much internal competition, however, can be\ncounterproductive. If an atmosphere of hard internal competition descends,\nplayers can be incentivised to stop rewarding each other with status and\nthere’ll be a paucity of supply. Life, under such conditions, can reek of\nstress and misery. It can also contribute to a game becoming corrupted.\n\nIn June 2001, Time magazine reported on one ‘fiercely competitive’ US\ncompany’s ‘rank and yank’ system by which employee performance was graded by\ncolleagues into various strata, the top 5 per cent announced as ‘superior’ and\nthe bottom 15 per cent at risk of losing their jobs. The magazine described\nthe process: ‘in a typically intense session, as many as twenty-five managers\nmay gather around a conference table in a windowless room with a computer\nscreen filled with employee rankings projected on one wall. Each participant\ncomes armed with notebooks bulging with job reviews. As the discussion\nproceeds, the managers may shift people from one ranking to another, deciding\ntheir fate with the click of a computer mouse.’ The reporter worried that\n‘competitive systems’ such as rank-and-yank could ‘stir suspicion and\ndiscourage teamwork’. One manager defended the arrangement: ‘You have to know\nwhere you stand, and I believe the system does an excellent job of doing\nthat.’ It was hard to deny the company’s success: it was the seventh largest\nin the USA, at its height valued at seventy billion dollars.\n\nJust four months after the Time article was published, the company went\nbankrupt. Several of its executives were prosecuted; one of them, CEO Jeff\nSkilling, facing charges including conspiracy, securities fraud and insider\ntrading, was eventually jailed for twenty-four years. The company was Enron,\nsometimes considered one of the most corrupt corporate organisations in\nhistory, with its culture of ruthless competitiveness at the heart of its rot.\n\nThe rule tweaks that made Enron’s game so perilously harsh would’ve generated\nintense rivalries between players. Rivalry is different from competition. It’s\na product of it, and is distinguished by its focus and ferocity.

It starts [when Apple CEO\nSteve](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos754246) Jobs encounters a senior\nexecutive from Microsoft, a rival technology game with whom Jobs had had a\nlong history of battles and who’d once dominated Apple almost to destruction.\nThe executive was married to a friend of Jobs’ wife Laurene, so the men met\nregularly. ‘Anytime Steve had any social interaction with that guy, Steve\nwould come back pissed off,’ former Apple executive Scott Forstall has said.\n‘He came back one time and that guy said Microsoft had solved computing … they\nwere going to do tablet computing and they were going to do it with pens. That\nguy shoved it in Steve’s face, the way they were going to rule the world with\ntheir tablets with pens. Steve came in Monday and there was a set of\nexpletives and then it was like, “Let’s show them how it’s really done”.’\nTriggered by the Microsoft man’s arrogant behaviour, Jobs set up a team to\nexperiment with a tablet that was operated not with pens, but with fingers.\nThe device they designed became the iPhone then re-emerged as the iPad. ‘It\nbegan because Steve hated this guy. That’s the actual origin of it,’ said\nForstall, who sagely added, ‘it was not good for Microsoft that Steve ever met\nthis guy.’\n\nSuccess doesn’t require being maddened by rivalry, like Steve Jobs, or forced\nto war after a jealously defended, limited store of status like the employees\nof Enron. Most of our status play happens nose-to-nose, with co-players\nimmediately around us. Like soldiers at war, we‘re usually sustained by the\nprizes that come, not from being at the very top, but from routine play with\nfamiliars: colleagues, family members, friends offline and on. We display\nknowledge of the game’s rules and follow them virtuously and with skill;\nproving ourselves of value to its overall mission. In our daily strivings, we\nhope our playing is appreciated and admired, just as we’re expected to pay\nthat admiration back. But the games we play have extraordinary power over us.\nAll too often, when the rules change, so do we.\n\n\n[10](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos4787)\n\n[The Slot Machine for Status](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos4787)\n\nWE’RE BEGINNING TO sense the power of the status game. In discerning the truth\nbeneath the myth of the human condition, we catch a glimpse of its immense\ncapacity for creating joy and havoc. When we earn connection and status, we\nthrive; when we lose it we can become sick, sad, suicidal and murderous. High-\nstatus women and men can mesmerise us, drawing us to theatres, convention\nhalls, cinemas and sports arenas. We can feel ourselves becoming almost\npossessed by them as our copy-flatter-conform mechanisms switch on. But this\nisn’t the only way we can be altered, without our conscious volition, by the\ngame. As the employees at Enron discovered, it’s possible for the rules to be\naltered such that they contribute to our corruption. The strategies by which\nwe earn connection and status shape who we are. To a significant extent, we\nbecome the puppets of the games we play.\n\nIn recent years, something like this has been happening to the [world’s\n3](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos754620).6 billion users of social\nmedia.

Social media is a status game. It can’t not be: it’s human life,\nunfolding online. It’s all there, the success games of the selfie-takers and\nhumble-braggers; the virtue games of the wellness gurus and political\ncampaigners; the dominance games of the mobbers and the cancellers. But the\neveryday striving that would’ve happened naturally, online, has been\nintensified by technologists who’ve tweaked their rules and symbols. They’ve\nmade these games both highly competitive and madly compulsive. [A 2019 survey\nof](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos754988) nearly two thousand US\nsmartphone users found they check their phones an average of ninety-six times\na day, about once every ten minutes. This marked a 20 per cent increase from\njust two years earlier. [Another survey, of\n1](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos755388),200 users, found 23 per cent\ncheck their phones less than a minute after waking and a further 34 per cent\nmanage to hold out between five and ten minutes. Only 6 per cent managed to\nwait two hours or more.\n\nThis reflects my experience. Despite the fact I only ever posted moderately on\nTwitter, rarely more than once a week on Instagram and never on Facebook, I\nstill found my smartphone had become a constant companion. I finally quit the\ndevice on the realisation that, even on walks with my wife and dogs in the\ncountryside, I couldn’t stop myself removing it from my pocket every couple of\nminutes and opening a social media app, my thumb moving up and down in a\nrepetitive scrolling hook. There’d be no conscious thought: the thing would\njust appear. Even when I left it at home, my hand would grab for my pocket\nrepeatedly, as if possessed by some alien presence.\n\nThat technology is strong magic. Its chief wizard is Dr B. J. Fogg, founder of\nthe Persuasive Technology Lab, which is based out of Silicon Valley’s favoured\neducational institution, Stanford University. Fogg’s legend grew in 2007 when\nhe started teaching a class in using his persuasive techniques to build apps\non Facebook. By the end of the [ten-week\ncourse](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos755780), his students had amassed\nsixteen million users between them, earning one million dollars in advertising\nrevenue.\n\nFogg’s fascination with controlling behaviour began when, [aged 10, he studied\npropaganda at school. ‘I learned\nnames](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos756090) for the various propaganda\ntechniques, and I could soon identify them in magazine ads and TV\ncommercials,’ he writes. ‘I felt empowered … I marvelled at how words, images,\nand songs could get people to donate blood, buy new cars, or join the Army.\nThis was my first formal introduction to persuasion. After that, everywhere I\nlooked I started seeing what I called “propaganda,” used for good purposes and\nbad.’ Growing up with a tech-obsessed father, Fogg wondered about harnessing\nthe power of computers to persuade. At Stanford, he studied how interacting\nwith them can ‘change people’s attitudes and behaviours’. In 2003 he published\nPersuasive Technology: Using Computers to Change What We Think and Do. Years\nbefore the invention of the smartphone, it outlined his vision of our\nconnected tomorrow: [‘Someday in\nthe](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos756359) future, a first-year student\nnamed Pamela sits in a college library and removes an electronic device from\nher purse.",

It’s just smaller than a deck of cards, easily carried around, and\nserves as Pamela’s mobile phone, information portal, entertainment platform,\nand personal organiser. She takes this device almost everywhere and feels a\nbit lost without it.’\n\nSuch devices, Fogg believed, would be ‘persuasive technology systems’. They’d\nbe able to change users’ thoughts and behaviours with a power that’d never\nbeen known in history. [‘Traditional media,\nfrom](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos756623) bumper stickers to radio\nspots, from print ads to television commercials, have long been used to\ninfluence people to change their attitudes or behaviours,’ he wrote. ‘What’s\ndifferent about computers and persuasion? The answer, in a word, is\ninteractivity.’ This device would interact with its user and its user’s life,\nadjusting its manipulative tactics as their situation changed, communicating\nwith them almost as if it was sentient. [‘When you\npack](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos756919) a mobile persuasive\ntechnology with you, you pack a source of influence. At any time (ideally, at\nthe appropriate time), the device can suggest, encourage, and reward; it can\ntrack your performance or lead you through a process.’ It could do this with\n‘microsuasion’ elements – notifications, badges or symbols of status: all the\nnudges with which we’re now familiar on social media.\n\nHe codified his theory in what he called the ‘Fogg Behaviour Model’. He taught\nthe model at ‘Behavior Design Boot Camps’ and at the Stanford Persuasion Lab\nthat Wired magazine called [‘a toll\nbooth](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos757206) for entrepreneurs and\nproduct designers on their way to Facebook and Google’. [The model said\na](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos757483) person is compelled to act when\nthree forces collide in a moment: motivation (we must want the thing); trigger\n(something must happen to trigger a desire to get more of it) and ability (it\nmust be easy). Take LinkedIn. At its launch, it visually represented the size\nof a user’s professional network with a hub-and-spoke icon. The bigger the\nicon, the greater the status. People want status (that’s the motivation), the\nicon generates a sudden urge to get more (that’s the trigger) and LinkedIn\nprovides an easy solution, in the use of the site to generate more connections\n(that’s ability). ‘Even though at the time [there was\nnothing](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos757742) useful you could do with\nLinkedIn, that simple icon had a powerful effect in tapping into people’s\ndesire not to look like losers,’ Fogg has said.\n\nBut the core of his dark genius lay in one brilliant further insight. It led\nto a tweak in the way status games are played on social media that would\nperhaps do more than any other to make them habitual. He described a way of\nissuing rewards such that they’d encourage compulsive behaviours. If a\nprogrammer wanted to create a certain action, in a user, they should offer a\nsymbol of reinforcement after they’d performed the desired ‘target behaviour’.\nBut here was the trick: the positive reinforcement would be inconsistent. You\nwouldn’t always know what you were going to get. [‘To strengthen\nan](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos758025) existing behaviour,\nreinforcers are most effective when they are unpredictable,’ Fogg wrote in\n2003.",

This type of\nunpredictable reward schedule makes the target behaviour – in this case,\ngambling – very compelling, even addictive.’\n\nThe story of Fogg’s lab is relatively well known amongst those with a\nbackstage interest in social media. The idea of turning phones into slot\nmachines came about before smartphones even existed; it certainly appears to\nhave worked. But there seems to be a missing piece to the theory. It’s not\nclear the technologists are fully aware what their users are actually gambling\nwith. Social media is a slot machine for status. This is what makes it so\nobsessively compelling. Every time we post a photo, video or a comment, we’re\njudged. We await replies, likes or upvotes and, just as a gambler never knows\nhow the slot machine will pay out, we don’t know what reward we’ll receive for\nour contribution. Will we go up? Will we go down? The great prize changes\nevery time. This variation creates compulsion. We just want to keep playing,\nagain and again, to see what we’ll get.\n\nThe simple act of using social media can be a Fogg-ish trigger, compelling us\nto play. We all want status and seeing others receive it creates an urgency to\ngrab some for ourselves. If we do well in the game, significant symbols of\nstatus may accrue to us: more followers and elite followers including\ncelebrities, some of whom we might even get to know. We may receive a blue\ntick or the ‘verified’ marker that’s sometimes awarded to top-tier players. A\nrare few achieve massive success across platforms and become wealthy. In 2020,\nYouTuber [Eleonora ‘Lele’](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos758302) Pons\nwas reportedly charging $142,800 for one sponsored Instagram post; fellow\nYouTuber Zach King was listed at $81,100. They had forty-one million and\ntwenty-three million followers on the photo sharing site respectively.\n[According to the Washington\nPost](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos758697), top YouTube stars earn\nbetween two and five million dollars a year from that platform alone.\n\nBut even those who are several galaxies distant from Lele and Zach can find,\nby investing sufficient time and energy into the game, their avatar may come\nto hold more status than they do in their ‘real’ offline life. To these\npeople, the platforms become massive repositories of status, an immeasurably\nprecious resource they’d find agonising to give up. To keep what they have,\nand earn more, they must keep playing: pulling the arm of that slot machine\nagain and again and again.\n\nEven in 2003 Fogg was aware of his theory’s dark power.

If we view the human condition from a conventional perspective, it\nmakes about as much sense as very fast running. What’s the point? Putting\npictures of your tanned knees on the internet, why bother? Arguing with\nstrangers over micro-disagreements concerning issues that’ll never affect you,\nwhat a waste of time. But if we understand ourselves not as heroes on journeys\nbut as biological machines designed to play symbolic games of status wherever\nwe go, the success of social media not only makes sense, it feels inevitable.\n\n\n[11](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos4891)\n\n[The Flaw](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos4891)\n\nTHERE’S NO HAPPY ending. That’s the bad news. But this is not how life feels.\nTo be alive, and to be psychologically healthy, is to be vulnerable to the\nstory of consciousness that tells us that with one particular victory, with\nthat peak finally climbed, we’ll be satisfied. Peace, happiness and delicious\nstillness will be ours. This, sadly, is a delusion. We’ll never get there\nbecause we’re playing a game for status. And the problem with status is, no\nmatter how much we win, we’re never satisfied. We always want more. This is\nthe flaw in the human condition that keeps us playing.\n\nConsider Paul McCartney. As a former member of The Beatles he’s spent his life\ninhaling status like oxygen. Demented fans, the adoration of the opposite sex,\nthe lifelong reputation of a genius and wealth never-ending, he’s had about as\nmuch of the stuff as anyone in modern history. And yet, even in the midst of\nit all, he found himself bothered by the fact that, on the sticky labels on\nhis records, and on all the sleeves, the songs he’d co-written were credited\nto ‘Lennon-McCartney’.\n\nLennon came first.\n\nWhy should Lennon come first? How was that fair? It hadn’t seemed important\nwhen, as bedroom-practising teenagers, they’d agreed the credit no matter\nwhich of them wrote what. But now, for some reason, it mattered. So McCartney\nmade a plan. Wherever his contracts gave him wiggle-room, he began switching\nthe names so Lennon came second. [His 1976 live\nalbum](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos759630), Wings Over America,\nfeatured five Beatles songs. He credited them to McCartney-Lennon. Then, prior\nto the 1995 release of the greatest hits collection Anthology, he asked if\nLennon could come second on ‘Yesterday’, a song McCartney had written alone.\n[Yoko Ono said no](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos760015).\n\nIn November 2002 McCartney released another live album. [Back in the\nU.S.](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos760283) featured nineteen Beatles\nsongs. And Paul McCartney flipped the names in the credits, every single one.\n[Ono wasn’t](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos760588) having it. She\ninstructed her lawyer to release a statement. McCartney’s actions, it said,\nwere ‘ridiculous, absurd and petty’. Then, apparently no stranger to a bit of\nridiculous, absurd and petty herself, she [reportedly removed his\nname](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos760969) from the Plastic Ono Band’s\nmost famous song, ‘Give Peace a Chance’, a credit Lennon granted him as thanks\nfor help with other music.",

And yet, the flipping. The order of the names. It seems he\nstill feels it: that craving, that tension, that disturbance in the blood.\nIt’s a flaw that seems to be a fact of human nature. Sociologist Professor\nCecilia Ridgeway describes experiments that tried to locate the point at which\nour need for status, once acquired, stabilises. [‘There was\nno](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos761750) point at which preference for\nhigher status levelled off,’ she writes. The researchers thought one reason\nthe desire for status is ‘never really satiated’ is because ‘it can never\nreally be possessed by the individual once and for all. Since it is esteem\ngiven by others, it can always, at least theoretically, be taken away.’ So we\nkeep wanting more. And more and more and more.\n\nThe flaw can be detected in how we feel about money, that shiny symbol we\noften use as a measure of status. No matter how much we earn, the flaw wants\nmore. And we convince ourselves we’re worth it. One [survey of more\nthan](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos761997) seventy thousand people\nfound almost two-thirds earning market-rate wages believed they were being\nshort-changed whilst only 6 per cent thought they were getting over the odds.\nA team led by psychologist [Professor Michael\nNorton](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos762242) contacted over two\nthousand people whose net worth started at one million dollars and rose to an\nawful lot more. They were asked to rate their happiness on a ten-point scale,\nthen say how much cash they’d need to be perfectly happy. ‘All the way up the\nincome-wealth spectrum,’ Norton reported, ‘basically everyone says two or\nthree times as much.’\n\nPerfectly happy. They’re not going to be perfectly happy. But that’s the flaw.\nIt’s part of the dream we weave of reality. It tells us there’s a destination.\nBut we’ll never stop wanting more. And, even though we may suffer wafts of\nimposter syndrome when feeling out of our depth in specific situations, we’re\nultimately pretty good at accepting any status that happens to wash back in\nour direction. This counts, too, for elites at the top of their games. They\naccept it. They get used to it. They become acclimatised to the myriad ways\nthey measure status: money; power; influence; flattery; clothing and\njewellery; mode of transport and allocation of seat therein; holiday and\nresidential locations; numbers of staff; size and luxury of house and\nworkspace; laughter at jokes; eye contact; body language; measures of orange\njuice poured in a glass. They’ve earned it! Then they want more. They get\nmore. Then that becomes normalised. It’s in this way that our bosses,\npoliticians and celebrities can become drunk on status, their behaviour\ngrowing ever more crazed.\n\nStatus drunkenness is extraordinary and ordinary and testament to how the game\ncan intoxicate human cognition.",

[The Czarina, Anna\nof](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos763117) Russia, insisted her courtiers\nwore a different suit each time she saw them. [Imelda\nMarcos,](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos763494) former First Lady of the\nPhilippines, had a thirst for success symbols that’s legendary: after enjoying\na safari in Kenya she flew a menagerie of African mammals into Calauit Island,\nevicting two hundred and fifty-four families to make way for it; such was her\nlove of building and buying impressive buildings, including several in\nManhattan, it was joked she had an ‘edifice complex’; after the Marcoses fled\ntheir palace, a single receipt from a 1978 splurge in a New York Bulgari store\nwas found for nearly one and a half million dollars. Marcos’s brain wove a\nself-serving dream that said such extravagance was virtuous, her ‘duty’ to the\npoor: ‘You have to be some kind of light, a star to give them guidelines.’ But\nmy favourite national leader is Turkmenistan’s Saparmurat Niyazov, aka the\n‘Father of all Turkmen’, who renamed the days of the week, a crater on the\nmoon, a breed of horse, a city, a canal, the months of the year and the word\nfor bread after himself and members of his family. He then had a huge gold-\nplated statue erected of himself, in the capital, which rotated so he always\nfaced the sun.\n\nStatus drunkenness is practically the defining condition of royalty, with its\npalaces and crowns and compulsory rituals of deference. [Prince Andrew was\nattacked](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos764376) for spending tens of\nthousands of taxpayer pounds on private flights to watch golf, but his\nextravagance had nothing on his ancestor George IV.

The condition of\nterrible, gibbering conceit that’s befallen some of our leaders of industry\nand finance was exposed following the global financial crisis. [When the CEOs\nof](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos765416) Ford, Chrysler and General\nMotors travelled to Washington on a begging mission for public money, they did\nso in private jets. Over in the UK a household name was made of Fred Goodwin,\nthe CEO who walked the Royal Bank of Scotland into debts of over £24 billion\nand a taxpayer bailout of £45 billion.\n\nGoodwin’s merciless appetite for cost-cutting earned him the title ‘Fred the\nShred’. But such sacrifices were not for him. In 2005 he oversaw the opening\nof a £350 million headquarters in which, newspapers reported, [he’d\nhad](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos765709) the director’s kitchens\nrelocated so his favourite lunch of scallops wouldn’t get too cold en route to\ntable. Fresh fruit was flown in daily from Paris. When a tiny stain was\nspotted in the lobby outside his football pitch-sized office, he ordered its\nredecoration with £1,000-per-roll wallpaper. One day, Goodwin sent an email\nthreatening disciplinary action after being accidentally served a pink\nbiscuit, subject line: ROGUE BISCUIT.\n\nAll of which shows that status drunkenness is real and resentment can be fun.\nBut as pleasurable as listing the excesses of the elites can be, the flaw that\nleads to them can be damaging to us all, not least when they manifest in the\ncompanies for which we work. Research by organisational psychologist Professor\nDennis Tourish found [people in lower\ncorporate](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos766289) ranks tend to\n‘habitually exaggerate the extent to which they agree with the opinions and\nactions of higher-status people as a means of acquiring influence’ while\ncritical views are mostly kept quiet. And then the flaw kicks in. Leaders,\nbeing human, are vulnerable to believing all this lovely status-boosting news.\nThey often accept praise and agreement uncritically and fail to grow\nsuspicious over the lack of bad news. Those who attempt to deliver it are\noften punished with a reputation for being [difficult, overly negative\nor](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos766599) not ‘team players’. They can\nultimately find their careers in jeopardy.\n\nThese bosses observe their place in the game and weave a self-serving dream\nthat explains it. Their brains make them the star of a heroic story in which\ntheir elevated status is wholly deserved. Stuck in their delusion, any news\nthat flatters feels like truth, just as any counter-news feels like an unjust\nattack. Reasonable dissenters are cast as villains and penalised. Other\nplayers, now fearful, hold their tongue. This situation is not uncommon. One\nsurvey found [85 per cent of](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos766894)\nemployees feeling unable to ‘raise an issue or concern to their bosses even\nthough they felt that the issue was important’. When Tourish and his team go\ninto companies and report back negative staff opinion, leaders are\n[‘frequently shocked’](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos767161). Whilst\nsome take it seriously, ‘many bitterly contest the findings. They argue that\nno one has ever brought such issues to their attention before and that the\ndata must therefore be flawed.’\n\nCanny players sense the flaw in their elites and seek to improve their own\nrank with flattery.

[A study of\n451](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos767690) CEOs found leaders who were\nexposed to more frequent and intense flattery and agreement rated their own\nabilities more highly, were less able to change course when things went wrong,\nand led firms that were more likely to suffer persistently poor performance.\nWhen Tourish warns leaders about such dangers they usually nod in easy\nagreement. [‘During workshops,\nmany](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos767952) have swapped amusing\nanecdotes that vividly describe the process in action,’ he writes. But ‘they\nthen mostly go on to assume that they themselves are immune to its effects. In\nreality, they almost never are.’ Tellingly Tourish has found the most\nsuccessful leaders are usually [those with the\n‘](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos768236)least compliant’ followers.\n\nOf course, most of us will never breathe these levels of status. But we can\nstill find warning from the experiences of CEOs, royals and celebrities. We\nall, to some extent or other, live inside a self-serving story. When we find\nourselves spoiled or flattered and fluttered at, we can often fail to question\nit. We accept it, we enjoy it, and we deserve more. And we’re never satisfied\nwith what we get. So we play on, believing the next move or the move after\nthat will make us happy, perhaps even perfectly so.\n\nBut status never makes us perfectly happy. In a small but fascinating study,\n[psychologists persuaded fifteen\nhighly](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos768525) identifiable American\ncelebrities, including a top-tier Hollywood actor, a basketball hero and an\nR&B superstar, to submit to an analysis of what actually happens at the Paul\nMcCartney heights. They described the initial surge of major status as\nsomething fantastical. One recalled, ‘the swell of people, the requests, the\nletters, the emails, the greetings on the street, the people in cars, the\nhonking of the horns, the screaming of your name … it starts to build and\nbuild like a small tornado, and it’s coming at you, and coming at you.’ Out of\nnowhere, ‘you’re worth something. You’re important.’\n\nThen comes the brain-story that says they’ve earned it. ‘My life is different\nin that people kiss my ass and that’s not always a good thing because then you\nstart believing that your ass is worthy of being kissed,’ said another. ‘You\nhave to constantly stay on guard for that. And I think it’s very hard. There\nare times when I exploit that. I take advantage of people sucking up to me, or\nthe power that I wield.’ As overwhelming as it is, it’s not enough. It’s never\nenough. Said another, ‘I’ve been addicted to almost every substance known to\nman and the most addicting of them all is fame.’\n\nThen, paranoia. ‘I don’t think you trust anybody the same way when you become\nwell-known … are they laughing at my jokes because they think I’m funny or\nbecause it’s me saying them?’ They start to lose people they love. ‘I’ve lost\nfriends … they feel inferior … You’re special and they aren’t. The next thing\nyou know, they’d really rather not have anything to do with you.’ Some\nsuperstars expressed disillusionment with the game. But it wasn’t the status\nitself that was the problem.",

They couldn’t care less who you are.’\n\nThe flaw is a component of the dream we weave around reality. It’s a quirk in\nour cognition that keeps us in the game and playing. If there’s any\nconsolation in these stories it’s that, paradoxically, it’s something of a\nleveller. The elites, so far above us, will never find what they’re looking\nfor. No matter who we are or how high on the scoreboard we climb, life is a\ngame that never ends.\n\n\n[12](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos4976)\n\n[The Universal Prejudice ](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos4976)\n\nTHERE’S A UNIVERSAL prejudice, a bias that unites humanity: we don’t like\nthose who swagger about above us in the higher ranks. This is a resentment\nthat transcends politics, class, gender and culture. Its gangrene drips\nthrough all of human life. People feel perfectly comfortable being perfectly\ncruel about celebrities, CEOs, politicians and royalty, as if their elevated\nrank makes them immune to pain. Some time ago, I caught myself chuckling at a\ntweet that said, ‘These are all real Telegraph columnists: Sophia Money-\nCoutts, Harry de Quetteville, Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, Boudicca Fox-Leonard.’\nWith a pinch of self-reproach I realised I was simply being invited to point\nand laugh at posh people. At last count, that tweet had been liked 27,000\ntimes.\n\nThis discomfort we feel towards conspicuously high-status players stretches\nback through the millennia and is a wired-in component of our game-playing\ncognition. Humans have always been incorrigible seekers of rank. Our jostling\nfor position was managed in Stone Age societies with such force that their\nhierarchies were much shallower than we’re used to today, with less inequality\nbetween the top and the bottom. [One recent\nstudy](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos769279) found no evidence of\nsignificantly heightened stress in low status women of the ‘egalitarian’ Hadza\ntribe of northern Tanzania. It’s sometimes claimed hunter-gatherers had no\nstatus game at all, and that we evolved in a kind of naive bliss of perfect\nequality. But it would be a mistake to conclude these shallow hierarchies are\nevidence we’re not programmed to care about status. On the contrary, writes\nthe psychologist Professor Paul Bloom, [‘egalitarian lifestyles\nof](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos769005) the hunter-gatherers exist\nbecause the individuals care a lot about status.

In contemporary hunter-gatherer groups, hunters who appear overly proud\nof their catch are routinely mocked: the anthropologist [Dr Elizabeth Cashdan\nwrites](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos770620) that among the !Kung\nhunters of the Kalahari, ‘if an individual does not minimise or speak lightly\nof his own accomplishments, his friends and relatives will not hesitate to do\nit for him’. They’ve been recorded teasing one such man, [asking of his\nkill](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos770886), ‘What is it? Some kind of\nrabbit?’ [In Inuit camps](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos771131), when\nsubtle facial disapproval, open shaming and public ridicule don’t succeed in\ndampening big shot behaviour, the entire tribe gathers around the cocky\noffender to sing a ‘song of derision’ in their face. Modern hunter-gatherer\ngossip remains preoccupied with [‘norm violations\nby](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos771379) high-status individuals’.\n[Studies in the developed](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos771632) world\nfind we too prefer tattle about high-status people, preferably of our own\ngender – rivals in our games.\n\nOur ill feeling towards high-status players has been captured in the lab. When\nneuroscientists had participants read about someone popular, rich and smart,\nthey saw brain regions involved in the perception of pain become activated.\nWhen they read of this invented person suffering a demotion, their pleasure\nsystems flared up. Psychologists see this effect cross-culturally, with one\nstudy in Japan and Australia [finding participants took\npleasure](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos771930) in the felling of a\n‘tall poppy’: the higher their status, the greater the enjoyment of their de-\ngrading. The most venomous levels of envy were reported when the poppy’s\nsuccess was in a ‘domain that was important to the participant, such as\nacademic achievement among students’ – when they were rivals in their games.\n\nAnd yet, as we’ve learned, we’re also drawn to high-status people: we crave\ncontact with the famous, the successful and the brilliant. So our relationship\nwith elite players is thunderously ambivalent. On one hand, we gather close to\nthem, offering them status in order to learn from them and, in the process,\nbecome statusful ourselves. On the other, we experience grinding resentments\ntowards them. This, perhaps, is one result of the mismatch between our neural\ngame-playing equipment and the massively outsized structure of modern games.\nOur brains may be specialised for small tribal groups but today – especially\nat work and online – we play colossal games in which poppies loom over us like\nredwoods. Status is relative: the higher others rise, the lower we sit in\ncomparison. It’s a resource and their highly visible thriving steals it from\nus.

To our subconscious these idols are fantastically accomplished\nversions of us: our copy, flatter, conform cognition overrides our resentment.\n\nThis uncomfortable mismatch that exists between the small games we’re\nprogrammed to play and the stretched games we actually play is the source of\nmuch conflict and injustice. The great stretching of the human game began when\nwe abandoned our campsites for settled farming and herding communities. The\nold tribal clans that were based around extended-family networks found\npermanent homes and fields in which to work. They then connected into larger\ncommunities. These were [often centred around\nvillages](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos772220), called chiefdoms. These\nextended-family-based groups began to specialise, arranging themselves around\ncertain games: blacksmiths, carpenters, herders. These became castes. Social\nstatus position and occupation became [increasingly defined by\nkin](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos772497) and lineage: you could be\nborn into a weaving, milk-selling or carcass-rendering caste. The class system\nwe have today, in which a person’s future status and occupation is strongly\ninfluenced by the accident of their birth, is a continuation of this process\nthat stretches back thousands of years, to the dawn of civilisation.\n\nIn these ancient communities, one family-based clan would inevitably become\nwealthier and more powerful than the others. As settled life developed, there\ngrew food surpluses [immeasurably greater than\nthat](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos773411) which existed in earlier\neras. There was also division of land. For the first time, major wealth began\nto accumulate in private hands. Most of it floated upwards, to the clan at the\ntop. And how would they explain their rise? By telling a self-serving story\nwhich said they deserved to be there: that they were truly special. [They’d\noften](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos772794) forbid intermarriage with\nlower clans, a move that enabled them to define themselves as a categorically\nseparate, divine class of human. [They’d\nlead](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos773105) the chiefdom, either via a\ncouncil of elders or a single ruler.\n\nWith these new accumulations of status and its symbols, the old method of\npolicing the game began to fail. Human tribes once successfully shrivelled\ntheir hierarchies using gossip: big shots and big shot behaviour were punished\nby the people. But now high-and-mighty rulers were able to emerge. And so our\nprehuman craving for major status roared forth in reanimated triumph. The\nstatus these elites experienced would’ve felt deserved to them, even god-\ngiven, as their brains wove their predictable, self-serving dreams. Then the\nflaw kicked in: they acclimatised to their levels of status and wanted more.\nGrabbing greater status meant leading larger groups: more players beneath them\nmeant more influence, more deference and more things that glittered. As\npopulations increased, territories merged and elites sought to expand their\ndomains in acts of invasion; chiefdoms became kingdoms and states and empires.\nOur fields of play became gigantic, the elites now playing above us at a\ngodlike distance.\n\nAs much as the great stretching benefitted those at the top, players on the\nlowest rungs began to suffer. They grew weaker and sicker.

Our settling down and\nclaiming the earth triggered a monstrous expansion of the status game from\nwhich we’ve never recovered.\n\nHumans are today as we’ve always been: ambitious and delusional animals. We’re\nalso jealous and resentful. Conspicuous symbols of others’ thriving – wealth,\npossessions, double-barrelled surnames in the Daily Telegraph – can alter how\nwe play the game of life. They can change us, making us meaner, harder and\nless co-operative. Social networks researcher Professor Nicholas Christakis\nled [an experiment in which](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos774062)\nparticipants played in three online worlds, the first egalitarian, the second\nwith midrange Scandinavian levels of inequality, the third with enlarged US\nlevels. Each set of players was randomly assigned to be rich or poor and given\nreal money. They then had to decide whether to contribute to the wealth of the\ngroup, take advantage for their own selfish ends or defect. Surprisingly, what\nmade the most difference to their behaviour wasn’t the level of inequality in\ntheir game, but whether or not the inequality was visible. When players’\nwealth was hidden everyone, including the elites, became more egalitarian. But\nwhen wealth was displayed, players in every game became less friendly,\ncooperated ‘roughly half as much’ and the rich were significantly more likely\nto exploit the poor.\n\nHumanity’s great stretching also led to another quirk of life that’s common\nand dreadfully consequential. As we’ve learned, we evolved to play status\ngames informally: whilst our rank, in hunter-gatherer tribes, was sometimes\nindicated externally in success cues – the hunter’s necklace of bones; the\nchief’s safer sleeping site – mostly it would’ve been sensed. We’d detect it\nin body language, voice tones and levels of deference. But when we formed\nsettled societies, chiefs, kings, priests, prime ministers and CEOs had their\nhigh status confirmed in titles and rituals, acts of enforced deference and\nsplendour. And so two parallel games began to be played: the formal game,\nannounced in the grand hierarchies of culture, economy and society, and the\ninformal true game, that continued to occur in the minds of the players.\n\nThis leads to a phenomenon that might be called the Prince Charles Paradox, in\nwhich one person can be simultaneously high and low in status. Prince Charles\nenjoys superlative amounts of formal status, being next in line to the British\nthrone. But he’s also relatively low in true status, with only [around half of\nhis](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos774499) British subjects holding a\npositive opinion of him. These dynamics can generate wild storms of misery for\nplayers when their leaders – be they a paranoid royal or a horrible boss –\nbecome insecure about their level of true status and demand of them ever-\ngreater demonstrations of loyalty, subservience and adoration.\n\nWe didn’t evolve to play games formally and we didn’t evolve to play games so\nsteep. But we did evolve to feel resentment. A long time ago, this dangerous\nemotion helped keep our tribes functional and their hierarchies shallow. It\nwould prick us into punishing those we felt were swaggering above us,\nattempting to claim status that was undeserved. Today we’re surrounded by such\npeople. The resentments they trigger can sour the story we tell of the world,\npopulating it with a ceaseless line-up of villains at whom we point and jeer\nand sing our songs of derision in all our righteousness and envy.",

Wearing it in public for the first time made me\nabsurdly proud. I was narcissistic on behalf of my glam metal kin: we were\nbetter than those idiots who liked boybands or rave. I knew this to be the\ntruth and I knew it totally. And now I was showing it, the imagined status\nsomehow pouring into me as I trotted like a prat up and down the pedestrian\nprecinct. This kind of behaviour, of course, is not unusual. It’s a standard\ncomponent of human life. The social taboo against big shot behaviour doesn’t\nhold for being boastful on behalf of our groups. On the contrary it’s\nconsidered ordinary, even laudable, to express such feelings.\n\nTo understand why, we can travel to the Republic of Niger and the city of\nMaradi. [It is 1974 and](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos775032) the\nanthropologist Professor Jerome Barkow has encountered a puzzle. Many of\nMaradi’s citizens were descendants of royal refugees from the nearby kingdom\nof Katsina. Back in the nineteenth century, their families had been forced to\nflee after their homelands were invaded by Islamic jihadists. These royal\ndescendants were now poor, having never recovered the elite stature of their\nancestors. Barkow expected them to harbour a vengeful hatred of the Muslims\nwho’d robbed them of their status. But, to his surprise, the opposite seemed\ntrue. ‘I was startled to find no hint of resistance to Islam, despite the\narea’s history,’ he writes. ‘Instead, I found individual after individual who\nclaimed to come from a deeply pious and scholarly family.’ Not only had Islam\nbecome a powerful force, it was growing.\n\nIt didn’t make sense. So Barkow began asking questions. He found two direct\ndescendants of Katsina royalty to interview. One had embraced Islam, the other\nhadn’t. Daya had studied with a Koranic scholar since boyhood. By 16 he’d\nmemorised the Koran and could recite it in sections – an achievement entitling\nhim to a prestigious graduation ceremony called a sauka. Daya continued to\nstudy the Koran for several hours a day. He had two wives, three children and\nwas poor but proud. At that time, Maradi was occupied by the French. Daya\nresented the countrymen who’d chosen to play the colonials’ game, enjoying\ntheir Francophile education and gaining status within their systems of power.\n‘His opinion of the French-educated bureaucratic elite was scathing. His\nrespect was reserved for the Koranic scholars, and he was spending several\nhours each day with them, and shared much of his income with them.’\n\nThen there was Shida. Like Daya, he too was a direct descendant of Katsina\nroyalty. Like Daya, he hadn’t benefitted from the Francophone schooling of the\nbureaucratic elite. But neither had Shida received a Koranic education.\nInstead he’d followed a more traditional path, apprenticing himself to a\ntrade, first to a tailor, then a peanut buyer. But apprenticing didn’t suit\nShida.",

But apprenticing didn’t suit\nShida. He kept quarrelling with his mentors and his professional relationships\nwould break down. A close friend blamed his failures on his ‘nobleman’s\nheart’. He believed Shida’s connection to royalty had made him too proud; he\ncouldn’t lower himself to the rank of apprentice peanut buyer. When Barkow met\nShida, he was being financially supported by his wife and mother. ‘Unlike\nDaya, who conveyed an impression of energy and self-confidence, Shida seemed\nphysically weak, stooped, and uncertain.’\n\nBoth men revelled in their statusful royal backgrounds. Both men had begun\ntheir adult lives full of ambition. But only Daya had found a game to play\nthat provided status enough to satisfy his nobleman’s heart. Daya had ‘based\nhis self-esteem on a conception of himself as a good Moslem’. For him, and for\nother royal descendants Barkow interviewed, ‘only Islamic learning was worthy\nof prestige. Other kinds of learning, when discussed at all, were disparaged\nas just a means of getting money. Daya and many like him were privately\nscornful of the Francophone elite who, however, largely monopolised political\npower … he could evaluate himself as of higher standing than the ruling\nbureaucrats by using prestige criteria having to do with Islam.’\n\nIn order for his status game to work for him, Daya had to have faith in its\n‘prestige criteria’. And so his brain wove for him a dream that said the game\nof Islam was not an act of shared imagination, but true. He was a virtuous\nactor in a god-created reality. This became his neural territory, his world.\nIts rules and symbols – its ‘prestige criteria’ – felt unquestionably valid.\nHis memorising of the Koran meant something real. He believed his dream was\ntrue and he believed it totally. He had to. The logic of the status game\ndemands we consider our groups to be worthy of high esteem. If we don’t think\nthey’re inherently statusful, how can we draw status from them? Belief in the\ndream nourished Daya: it filled his nobleman’s heart with ‘energy and self-\nconfidence’. He tied himself to its puppet strings. It became his identity.\nJust as Ben Gunn rescued himself from having his status removed in prison, and\nElliot Rodger temporarily rescued himself from bullying and rejection in the\nWorld of Warcraft, so Daya rescued himself from having his royal rank removed\n– by joining the very game responsible for his ancestors’ fall. Whilst he\nthrived, the other man shrivelled. Shida didn’t believe in the status game of\npeanut buying, and that left him ‘weak, stooped, and uncertain’.\n\nWithin the games we play, we police each other.

This grandiosity we feel for our games is highly conspicuous in\nsports. Even if a football team is low in the league, its supporters can spend\nmuch of their social time persuading each other that they’re actually somehow\nsuperior. They seek out canny arguments to devalue rivals, reframing losses as\ninjustices or near-wins and reliving glories from the past. The more they\nconvince each other, the more their dream thickens up and the more\nnarcissistic they grow on behalf of their games. This is status play. It’s\ndishonest and it’s spiteful and it’s one of life’s great pleasures.\n\nThis groupish grandiosity is also conspicuous in nationalism.

Just like sports fans,\nmany citizens draw personal status from that of their nation, even if\nunconsciously. I don’t consider myself nationalistic even slightly but when I\nmoved to Australia I had the dismaying experience of finding myself speaking\nin an exaggerated English accent in public. I had to force myself to speak\nnormally. It was embarrassing, and actually a terrible strategy for gaining\nstatus in Australia. Nevertheless, to some moronic part of my brain, my sense\nof myself as an English person was clearly important (I’d also get annoyed\nwhen they called us ‘whingeing poms’, even though we are.)\n\nResearch into the effects of national status on individual happiness suggests\nI’m not alone. [A study tracking\nhappiness](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos775848) in Britain over the\nlast two centuries, by analysing the language in millions of books and\nnewspaper articles, found the national mood experienced a peak in the 1880s.\nThis might’ve been an era of widespread poverty, disease and child labour, but\nit was when Britain was near the top of the global status game, approaching\nthe pinnacle of empire.

[In one study,\n5](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos776538)-year-olds were given a coloured\nT-shirt to wear and were then shown pictures of various children, some in\nmatching shirts, others not. They knew their colour was random and meaningless\nand yet they still thought more positively of kids wearing the same colour,\nbelieving them to be more generous and kind. They also rewarded them unfairly,\nallocating them more toy coins in a game. They even remained more statusful in\ntheir memories: they were better able to recall the positive actions of their\nshirt-wearing brethren than the equally positive actions of those in different\ncolours.\n\nThis is the truth of human nature: we’re helpless players of games and are\nprogrammed to play unfairly. The brain judges our status in contest mode, by\ncomparing what we have to others. The more our group possesses, and the higher\nit climbs versus rival groups, the more of the great prize we personally win.\nPerhaps even more damaging than our tendency towards avarice and shadiness is\nthe fact our brains hide these behaviours from us. They tell a self-serving\nstory in which we’re not calculating players of games but moral heroes. It’s\nnot us or our co-players who are deluded, greedy and corrupt, it’s everyone\nelse. It’s the blue T-shirts that are truly superior, it’s the Islamists, it’s\nthe French, it’s the British Empire, it’s that prat in the precinct who spent\nfour quid in Woolworths and now thinks he’s King of Tunbridge Wells.\n\n\n[14](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos5169)\n\n[Subjugation, Revolution, Civilisation\n](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos5169)\n\nOUR TENDENCY TO believe the stories spun by brains and cultures is a source of\nmuch of the injustice that’s stained human history. Determined as we are to\naward ourselves and our playmates all the prizes, we excel at perceiving only\nthe self-serving sliver of the truth. Our stories often benefit us, convincing\nus of the righteousness of our fight, motivating us to play harder for ever-\ngreater rank. But they can sometimes work against us. They can even persuade\nus to conspire in our own subjugation.\n\nThis is a role the great religions have played. The hidden truth of religions\nis that they’re status games: Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and Christians agree\na set of rules and symbols by which to play, then form a hierarchy along which\nthey rise and fall. The dream that’s woven over this truth often tells of\nmajor status rewards not in this life but the next. Religions, it hardly needs\npointing out, are virtue games. This means that to succeed – to earn\nconnection and respect in this life and then heaven or a superior life via\nreincarnation – a player must be moralistic, faithful, obedient and dutiful.\nThey must do as their gods, priests and sacred texts instruct.\n\nThe ultimate purpose of all status games is control.

At over two thousand years old, it’s probably the oldest\ncultural status game on earth. It’s also likely the most complex, with [3,000\ncastes and](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos777338) 25,000 subcastes\norganised into five major strata: priests and teachers at the top who were\nmade from the creator god Brahma’s head; warriors and rulers that came from\nhis arms; farmers, traders and merchants from his thighs; labourers from his\nfeet; and then, at the bottom, the untouchables.

Early written\nreferences to untouchability are [found in the\nLaws](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos777854) of Manu, which date to\nbetween the second and third century BC. People expressed [‘grave\nanxiety’](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos778130) and ‘horror’ at having\n‘any kind of contact’ with untouchables, writes researcher Malay Neerav. If a\nhigh-status person touched an untouchable they were required to bathe; [if the\nshadow of](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos778537) an untouchable fell\nover a teacher’s meal, the food would be rendered unclean and destroyed. They\n[lived in separate colonies](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos778839) and\ndidn’t share wells. Romantic contact was taboo.

If we’re all such relentlessly ambitious\nplayers, why have the untouchables cooperated, for thousands of years, with\nthis monstrously degraded dream of life? Many do so because they believe it.\nPious untouchables accept they’ve earned their de-grading by committing sins\nin a past life; only by following the rules in the present will they win\nhigher status in the next. This is how many major religions have compelled\npeople to conspire in their own subjugation. You win by knowing your place and\nstaying in it, in the expectation of rewards after death. Everything was God-\ncreated, went the logic, so people were precisely where God wanted them to be.\nAs the Christian hymn sings it: ‘The rich man in his castle, the poor man at\nhis gate, God made them high or lowly, and ordered their estate.’\n\nIf a low-caste player in a virtue society such as India did muster the vision\nto throw for higher rank, their co-players would often conspire to yank them\nback down. The [novelist V. S.\nNaipaul](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos779686) writes of a businessman\nwho, impressed with the intelligence of an untouchable servant, provided for\nhis education and promotion. But years later, on his return to India, he found\nhim back where he’d started, cleaning toilets. ‘He had been boycotted by his\nclan for breaking away from them; he was barred from the evening smoking\ngroup. There was no other group he could join, no woman he could marry. His\nsolitariness was insupportable, and he had returned to his duty.’ Explaining\nthis incident, political economist Professor Timur Kuran writes that ‘[by\nostracizing a peer](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos779971) who has taken\na better job, the latrine cleaners can protect their own personal and\ncollective reputations. They can signal to the entire community, including\ngroups higher up in the social hierarchy, their willingness to live by the\nprevailing social rules.’ There was status to make by ruining the ambitious\nman so he was pulled back under by the luckless logic of the game.\n\nIn the modern era, not all of India’s untouchables fully buy the ancient story\nthat’s responsible for their fates. One study found [about a third\naccepting](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos780237) they’d earned\nuntouchability by committing sins in past lives, with others blaming\nunfairness or believing a more self-serving version of the Hindu dream,\nclaiming ‘they never took a true plunge in status, that they were really\nBrahmans in disguise’. Tellingly, some untouchables seek to restore their\nsense of relative status by looking down at those even more untouchable than\nthey.

Instead, we’re\npreoccupied with the busy business of ordinary life and the status we expect\nit to supply. This is even more true in virtue-based societies and eras. Back\nin the age of kingdom and empire, we might’ve been ruled by some distant\nleader in theory, but we’d mostly be concerned with obligations to our tight-\nknit clan and adhering to its local rules and symbols. Life was small,\nconfined to a small territory and a small group. Playing well with the people\nimmediately around us would’ve characterised its game.\n\nAs long as those games functioned properly, and our group received the rewards\nit expected, the status quo would likely be maintained. A robust society is\none in which the general populace is protected from outside threat and status\ntrickles down in ways that are expected. Even if elite groups – the religious,\nlegal, military, bureaucratic, aristocratic games – get nearly all the\nrewards, and bottom castes virtually none at all, stability won’t usually be\nthreatened. [What creates revolutionary\nconditions](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos781166) isn’t the steepness of\nthe inequality but the perception the game has stopped paying out as it\nshould.\n\nThis is why poverty alone doesn’t tend to lead to revolutions. Revolutions –\ndefined as mass movements to replace a ruling order in the name of social\njustice – have been found to occur in middle-income countries more than the\npoorest. Sociologist Professor Jack Goldstone writes, ‘what matters is that\npeople feel they are losing their proper place in society for reasons that are\nnot inevitable and not their fault’. The anxiety caused by their games’ loss\nof status reflects that which is found in the depression and suicide research.\nWhat goes for ourselves goes for our groups: when we and our people sense our\ncollective status is in decline, we become dangerously distressed.\n\nWhen a game’s status begins to slip, its players can be merciless. But for a\nrevolution to succeed, the games at the bottom of the hierarchy require the\nhelp of the elites: [‘indeed,’\nwrites](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos781436) Goldstone, ‘in most\nrevolutions it is the elites who mobilise the population to help them\noverthrow the regime.’ Examinations of the years leading up to revolutions\ntend to find ‘rulers have become weakened, erratic, or predatory so that many\nof the elites no longer feel rewarded or supported, and are not inclined to\nsupport the regime’. Elites then conspire with games beneath them, ‘popular\ngroups’ such as peasant communes, workers’ unions, professional guilds or\nyouth organisations, who also feel their position is declining and their\nexpected rewards are not being met.\n\n[Such dynamics drove Tunisia](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos781720)’s\n‘Jasmine Revolution’.

One, the Tunisian General Labour Union, organised national\nstrikes, then the army refused to shoot at Tunisian citizens. Games up and\ndown the hierarchy turned on Ben Ali. Just four weeks after Bouazizi’s\nprotest, he fled.\n\nElsewhere, [Goldstone finds a\npredictable](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos782011) precursor to societal\ncollapse to be ‘elite-overproduction’ – when too many elite players are\nproduced and have to fight over too few high-status positions. A moderate\nlevel of overproduction is beneficial, as it creates healthy competition and\nincreases the quality of the elites that do end up occupying its most\nprestigious positions, in government, media, the legal world, and so on. But\ntoo much overproduction leads to resentful cadres of failed elites forming\ntheir own status games in opposition to the successful. They begin warring for\nstatus, attacking the establishment, which contributes to its destabilisation.\nGoldstone finds these dynamics in the years leading up to the English Civil\nWar, the French Revolution and crises in China and Turkey. Once again, we find\nchaos and history being made in the aftermath of the game’s expected rewards\nfailing to pay out.\n\nEven when societies don’t fall to revolution or elite overproduction, [those\nwho rule them](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos782562) can become tamed\nand toppled by status play. This is true for civilisations that have endured\nfor centuries. When a status-hungry imperial force conquers a people, they\nestablish themselves as elites. As the generations pass, indigenous people,\nseeking status, increasingly play the empire’s games, adopting its rules and\nsymbols: speaking its language, worshipping its gods, working for its\ninstitutions. Eventually, desiring full and unprejudiced membership of the\nelites, they demand equal status and often do so with aggression in the form\nof civil disobedience, legal challenge or violence. Thus begins the fall of\nthe empire’s founders. Historian Professor Yuval Noah Harari describes this as\nthe ‘imperial cycle’ by which conquered cultures are ‘digested’ by imperial\ngames that continue to ‘flourish and develop’ even after its founders are long\nejected.\n\nThese dynamics have unified regions such as China and India, creating vast\ncivilisations. In India, the British brought oppression, murder, and\nexploitation, but they also stitched together what had been a [‘bewildering\nmosaic of](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos782908) warring kingdoms,\nprincipalities and tribes’, founded the judicial system, built the railways\nessential for the economy and an administrative structure that remains relied\nupon today.",

This pattern of status-striving has repainted the world. [Most\nhumans alive today](../Text/index_split_037.html#filepos783167) are playing by\nthe rules and symbols of their long-vanquished overlords.\n\nThe hidden rules of the status game have helped drive human history. Over\nhundreds and thousands of years our endless strivings have led to invasion,\nsubjugation, revolution, oppression and civilisation. This should come as no\nsurprise. After all, history is made by people and people are born to play.\n\n\n[15](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos5283)\n\n[Making a Player](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos5283)\n\nIN MODERN WESTERN societies, we live inside a story that says, if we want it\nbadly enough, we can do anything. Open the door, step outside, go for it. This\ncultural myth tells us to shoot for the moon. But the reality of shooting for\nthe moon is that it requires years of training, millions of dollars, the\nsupport of a major space agency and a rocket. Without that, you’ll fall to\nearth and break your back. It takes a certain kind of person, with a certain\nkind of background, to successfully shoot for the moon. And you’re probably\nnot it.\n\nThe sad fact is, the human world doesn’t actually resemble a bazaar crammed\nwith games we can select at will. The reasons we find ourselves playing the\ngames we do are several, not random, and frequently out of our control. They\ntend to form between people who have aspects of character and personality in\ncommon: teachers, soldiers, politicians, comedians, competitive cat groomers\nand astronauts tend to be coalitions of like-minded people. [Nobody gets to\nchoose](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos783510) exactly what kind of mind\nthey have – whether they’re confident, shy, a genius, extroverted, or love\nboxing or literature or smoking weed or the politics of left or right. These\nthings mostly happen to us depending on how our brains develop and what kinds\nof experiences we have.\n\nThree major forces conspire to push us in certain directions: genes,\nupbringing and peer group. We’ve already learned how, especially in childhood,\nthe brain draws information from the culture that surrounds it and shapes us\nto its contours. But the process of honing begins before even this. The\nbrain’s roughly 86 billion neurons are made in the womb, as are major\ncomponents of our hormonal and neurochemical systems. This is the biological\nequipment through which we’ll process reality – and its design is unique to\nus. How it’s wired up is directed partly by random biological events and\npartly by instructions encoded in genes we inherit from our parents. This\ngenome strongly influences the ways we perceive and respond to the games of\nlife. For instance, how anxious we are is thought to depend partly on a brain\nregion called the amygdala and a hormone called serotonin. Just as nobody has\nexactly the same fingerprints, nobody has exactly the same amygdalae or\nserotonin system. Some people happen to be wired with an increased sensitivity\nto threat: their alarm is triggered more easily. They’re likely to be more\nneurotic, more cautious and more sensitive to criticism. They may also\nstruggle socially.\n\nThis personality difference can have a significant effect on the games they’ll\nend up playing.",

Someone high in anxiety may be attracted to different games\nthan a natural taker of risks. When I interviewed personality psychologist\nProfessor Daniel Nettle, he predicted that, as a writer, I’d be high in the\ntraits of neuroticism and openness to experience: I took a personality test\nand discovered he was correct. [Researchers find\n‘the](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos783840) jobs in which we spend a\nlarge portion of our lives and the prestige and income that comes from those\njobs are at least partly influenced by the genes we inherit from our parents’.\nFor geneticist Professor Robert Plomin, the contribution our genes make to our\nbecoming who we are is [‘not just\nstatistically](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos784154) significant, it is\nmassive’.\n\nOur genes also influence how successful we’ll be. People wired to experience\ngreater feelings of thrill and reward when they win are more likely to become\nwealthy. Most billionaires become billionaires, in part, because they’re\nmonstrously competitive. They may be extroverts who, writes Nettle, [‘tend to\nbe](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos784416) ambitious’ and ‘are prepared\nto work very hard in pursuit of fame or money’. Even more successful are those\nwith a stellar capacity for self-control. This is associated with a trait\nknown as conscientiousness, which is the [‘most reliable\npersonality](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos784706) predictor of\noccupational success across the board’.\n\nSo we’re born with inherited tendencies, a set of predilections, a groove that\nguides our development. But genes don’t spell destiny or doom. During our\nformative years, our brains continue being wired up by the rules and symbols\nof our time and place. Early life experiences steer us, one way or another,\ninto becoming specific types of people with specific suites of beliefs,\ninterests and attitudes about the world. These help define our modes of play.\nAnthropologist Professor Adrie Kusserow has made a fascinating investigation\ninto how social class impacts parenting. She spent time with white parents in\nthree New York City area communities: impoverished Queenston where she ‘could\nnever wear sandals [because of\nall](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos785012) the broken crack vials\nlittering the streets’; patriotic, blue-collar Kelley, its residents of mainly\nIrish, German and Italian heritage, [a ‘safe\nand](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos785307) neat community’ with a ‘great\ndeal of pride’; and finally, Parkside, a wealthy district in Manhattan.\n\nPoor and blue-collar children were taught the game was tough and success\nrequired resilience.

[‘Examples\nof the](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos786420) child’s lower status were\nmanifested in the child not having access to all parts of the house or pieces\nof furniture (for example, the parent’s bedroom, the dining room for guests, a\nfather’s chair) and the child having to use a respectful tone of voice in\ntalking with parents.’\n\nIn both these groups, status was awarded for being maximally resilient. But\nthe parents differed profoundly in their reasons for making this such an\nimportant rule. In Queenston, resilience was required to give children the\nstrength of character to protect themselves from absolute destruction at the\ngame’s bottom. Queenston parents ‘saw themselves as [holding their\nown](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos786720) in a jungle of violence and\ncorrupt youth’. In Kelley, resilience took a more optimistic form. There, it\nwas required to break through into better status games. They wanted their\nyoung to have the mettle to: [‘try things\nout](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos786985)’, ‘stand out’, ‘get a lot\nmore out of this world’, ‘break away’, ‘go for your dreams’. One parent told\nKusserow, [‘I want my](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos787254) kids to\ndefinitely strive for everything they can possibly get – not take it, but work\nfor it.’\n\nBut in wealthy Parkside Kusserow found a radically different type of player\nbeing built. There, children were seen not as tough warriors of the game but\nas fragile buds that needed to be [‘opened out\ninto](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos787541) the world, into a successful\ncareer’. [Parents emphasised ‘the](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos787829)\ndelicacy of the child’s self, the extreme care, resources, wide canvas and\ngentle touch needed in helping this unique self to “flower” and open up to its\nfull potential’.

[Kusserow noted various\ntechniques](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos788672) that encouraged this\nthinking, including: children calling teachers by their first names;\nconsulting the child on the solving of family problems; allowing them to\n‘teach the parent’ and adults asking, ‘How can I help you get what you want?’\nOne father said of his daughter, ‘My basic feeling is that I have no right to\ndiscipline her … I’m conscious of the power differential and I don’t feel just\nbecause I’m bigger and stronger and know more that I have the right to push\nher around because we disagree on something.’ His daughter was 3.\n\nMothers and fathers in every area wanted the best for their children, but\nParkside parents wanted the best:\n[‘I’m](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos788971) not interested in the\nnormal, I’m interested in the best,’ said one mother. ‘My daughter is\nextraordinary at chess and ice skating, for which I pay through the nose for\nher to be extraordinary at.’ Ironically, however, Kusserow found the children\nwho were treated as the delicate, precious equals of their elders could show\nless stability. [‘What seems\nlacking](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos789242) for some Parkside\nchildren is the sense of security, protection, respect and humility that can\narise from knowing that one is not at the top of the hierarchy,’ she wrote.\nThese children were told they were delicate and so they felt delicate, but at\nthe same time automatically deserving of an elite position. Kusserow’s\nresearch was published in 2004. The striking mix of fragility and entitlement\nshe found seems characteristic of the status-striving of some of our most\nprivileged young adults today.\n\nIn the early years of childhood, our status-striving often takes the form of\ndominance as we demand what we want and, when thwarted, attempt to force our\nwill with tears, tantrums and teeth. It’s in adolescence that we begin to play\nadult games. We leave the hierarchy of the family for the contests of the\noutside world. This is our time of joining.\n\nAt least in the developed world, the games we join in adolescence usually take\nthe form of a clique or peer group – a set of people with whom we can\ncomfortably play. This begins to happen in adolescence partly as [a result of\nalterations](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos789525) to a region of the\nbrain that makes us much more sensitive to the judgements of others. We start\nto desire the reward of social approval and dread rejection. This sudden\nsensitivity to reputation makes teenagers highly prone to self-consciousness\nand embarrassment. Between the ages of 11 and 14, writes neuroscientist\nProfessor Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, they [‘become increasingly\naware](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos789806) that others have the\ncapacity to evaluate them, and as a result may overestimate the extent to\nwhich this actually occurs’.\n\nAs their brains continue to change, they begin to feel [the presence of\nan](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos790063) ‘imaginary audience’ of\nothers, constantly watching and judging them, a feeling that [‘remains quite\nhigh](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos790480) even in adulthood’. Unlike\nyounger people, teenagers are likely to take the evaluations of their peers to\nbe a true indication of their self-worth – or lack of it.",

As their self-esteem\nshifts from being based on how they feel in the moment to how they imagine\ntheir peers are evaluating them, they begin to crave their approval. Their\nchase for status can become all consuming. [‘By the\ntime](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos790748) we are thirteen,’ writes\npsychologist Professor Mitch Prinstein, ‘it seems as if there is nothing more\nimportant to us than this type of popularity. We talk about who has it. We\nstrategise how to get it. We are devastated when we lose it. We even do things\nwe know are wrong, immoral, illegal, or dangerous merely to obtain status, or\nto fiercely defend it.’\n\nIn order to gorge on the status they so desire, teenagers connect into status\ngames and play them. We’ve joined our tribes at about this age for at least\ntens of thousands of years. In premodern societies, adolescence is thought to\nhave been a [‘critical window for](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos791014)\nacquiring status’, much like the window we have in early childhood for\nacquiring language. This emergence into adulthood has sometimes been marked\nwith agonising initiation ceremonies: [teeth are yanked\nout](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos791321); little fingers removed;\ndrugs or poisons swallowed; skin whipped, sliced, burned or tattooed.\n[Initiates into the\nBimin](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos791591)-Kuskusmin tribe, of Papua\nNew Guinea, have their septum pierced with a cassowary bone dagger and have\nscalding fat dripped down their arms as they ‘struggle and shriek as large\nblisters form’. Young initiates ‘may be terrified’, writes anthropologist\nProfessor Alan Fiske, ‘but they are typically proud to have reached the status\nof prospective inductees … usually, they go willingly to be initiated, or even\neagerly request it’. Such tortures are designed to mark the person’s body with\na tribal identifier, thus [‘the mutilated\nindividual](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos791905) is removed from the\ncommon mass of humanity’.\n\nInductions don’t only take place in traditional societies, and not all are\nviolent. Some religious groups require adolescents to formally accept or\nreject the game they were raised in: Catholics and protestants call this\nconfirmation, the Amish rumspringa; they happen around age 14. Jewish\nmitzvahs, at 12 or 13, mark the passage into full accountability under their\ngame’s rules.\n\nBut in other contemporary groups the violence remains. Young men joining\nstreet-gangs or armies are sometimes ‘beaten in’ ([‘all those\nsticks](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos792196) that you were beaten with\nput into you another ideology,’ remarked one Mai-Mai militia inductee in the\neastern Congo).

It\nseparates those who have undergone it from the larger groups of people around\nthem, a separation that the former initiates of hazing see as lifting them\nover those less, unhazed people.’\n\nEven if we’re not required to humiliate or break ourselves, we still find\nourselves proudly displaying our membership of games with clothing, cultural\ntastes, beliefs or attitudes. This game we’ve joined has rules and symbols we\nadopt as our own – often to our parents’ horror – and, when we do, we lock\ninto a neural territory. Our co-players become our people, our tribe, our kin,\nthey a source of our status, and we a source of theirs.\n\nThis brain-directed emergence into adult games usually happens around the time\nwe start secondary school. Adolescent students learn a harsh lesson of human\nlife: not only are there hierarchies of status within games, the games\nthemselves form a hierarchy, with some nearer the top, and others lower down.\nElite cliques are formed by players who are naturally better at making\nfriends. [‘Social mammals are](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos792825)\nstatus seeking, that is, interested in befriending powerful, appealing, or\npopular individuals,’ writes Professor Nicholas Christakis, an expert in\nsocial networks. ‘Those desirable partners tend to be connected to other\ndesirable partners because they get to choose who they are friends with.\nPartly as a result, less popular individuals wind up being friends with less\npopular individuals.’ It’s this type of sorting that results in our ‘status-\nbased society’.\n\nIn the mid-nineties, [a team led\nby](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos793081) anthropologist Professor Don\nMerten captured teens discovering the rough realities of the status game at a\nmiddle-class junior high in a suburb of Chicago. With their game-playing\ncognition fully coming online, new arrivals found themselves being\nautomatically sorted into a hierarchy of status games, with ‘trendies’,\n‘jocks’ and ‘preppies’ at the top and ‘nerds’, ‘burnouts’ and ‘mels’ at the\nbottom. ‘They’re judging you this year, and that’s what I don’t like,’ said\none interviewee. ‘Because they never used to judge you last year … this year\nthey’re judging you on what you look like, what clothes you wear, what kind of\nfriends you hang out with. Like if your friend is a burnout, then you’re a\nburnout.’\n\nStatus games also formed around after-school activities that existed in an\n‘informal hierarchy’ that was ‘generally agreed upon by the students’. The\nmost prestigious game for boys was the basketball team whilst for girls it was\nthe cheerleader squad (the rank of the ‘Creative Stitchery Club’ remains sadly\nunrecorded). The year Merten’s team visited, around fifty girls tried out for\njust eight cheerleader spots that were usually filled exclusively from a\nclique of ‘socially prominent’ girls. The elite few who made it found it\n‘difficult to contain their exhilaration’ but yet instinctively felt moved to\ndisguise their big shot feelings. One was documented saying she’d never wear\nher cheerleader uniform to school again after her friends cheered when she\nwalked into PE all decked out in it. This made her ‘terribly embarrassed’, she\ninsisted. Except, noted the ethnographer, ‘you could tell that she loved the\nwhole thing’.\n\nThat year, the cheerleaders were in for a shock. It would be their next harsh\nlesson in the status game.",

This made her ‘terribly embarrassed’, she\ninsisted. Except, noted the ethnographer, ‘you could tell that she loved the\nwhole thing’.\n\nThat year, the cheerleaders were in for a shock. It would be their next harsh\nlesson in the status game. One of the lowest games at the school, just above\nthe mels, were the burnouts. Unlike the groomed, polished and socially oiled\npreppie elite, the burnouts had a reputation for scruffiness, rebellion and\nthe casual enjoyment of drugs, alcohol and sex. Some of them wore bandanas. Of\ncourse, no burnout could ever be selected as a cheerleader. Except that’s what\nhappened. One cheerleader explained to the researchers the magnificent agony\nthey endured as a result of burnout ‘Jackie’ joining their game. ‘It was\nreally hard in the beginning because they would say the names [of the\ncheerleaders] over the speakers as we walked down the hall. Everyone would go,\n“Oh god, how come all the losers made it this year?” … I would be like almost\ncrying. Paula told me that Rod went on the bus and he goes, “We are not coming\nto any of the games any more because our cheerleaders are losers.”’\n\nThey turned on Jackie in rehearsals. A friend reported, ‘If Jackie did one\nthing wrong, they jumped on her back just because that gave them reason to be\nmad at her. I didn’t like that. I mean, if it’s something as little as that,\nlike she didn’t do a jump or something at the right time and she was two\nseconds late or something, they’d get really mad at her.’\n\nThe second harsh lesson those cheerleaders learned was that status leaks.\nPrestigious games and individuals can find their position threatened by\nproximity to those of lower rank. But this particular story’s ending seems a\nhappy one, because the opposite is also true: lower-status people can use the\nproximity principle to move up. Burnout Jackie saw her rank rise. When one\ncheerleader was asked if people saw Jackie differently, following her\nselection, she said, ‘Well, I guess that they don’t think of her as a burnout\ntoo much any more, or a real slutty person. I don’t know. She is going out\nwith Mark Williams. Everyone is like, “Mark Williams? Why is Mark going with\nher?”’\n\nAfter school the games of true adulthood await. As we discovered in the darkly\ncompetitive world of Enron, the games we join have the power to corrupt us.\nThis process has been captured in an extraordinary [paper by Patrick\nJ](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos793458). Schiltz – former big-firm\nattorney, Associate Professor of Law at Indiana’s prestigious Notre Dame Law\nSchool and present-day judge. Addressing a cadre of incoming law students, he\nwrote: ‘If you go to work for a big firm, you will probably begin to practice\nlaw unethically in at least some respects within your first year or two in\npractice. This happens to most young lawyers in big firms. It happened to me.’\n\nThose who yearn to become big-firm lawyers are, he writes, a ‘remarkably\ninsecure and competitive group of people’. They’ve spent their entire lives\ncompeting through the education system to get where they are. ‘Now that\nthey’re in a big law firm, what’s going to happen? Are they going to stop\ncompeting? Of course not. They’re going to keep competing – competing to bill\nmore hours, to attract more clients, to win more cases, to do more deals.\nThey’re playing a game. And money is how the score is kept in that game.’\nTheir fever for lucre is exacerbated by regular trade press articles on how\nmuch this or that big shot is making.",

It happened to me.’\n\nThose who yearn to become big-firm lawyers are, he writes, a ‘remarkably\ninsecure and competitive group of people’. They’ve spent their entire lives\ncompeting through the education system to get where they are. ‘Now that\nthey’re in a big law firm, what’s going to happen? Are they going to stop\ncompeting? Of course not. They’re going to keep competing – competing to bill\nmore hours, to attract more clients, to win more cases, to do more deals.\nThey’re playing a game. And money is how the score is kept in that game.’\nTheir fever for lucre is exacerbated by regular trade press articles on how\nmuch this or that big shot is making. Lists of lawyers’ incomes are published\nbiannually and ‘pored over by lawyers with the intensity that small children\nbring to poring over the statistics of their favourite baseball players’.\n\nThis is how youthful idealism stales and grows mould. They arrive at their big\nfirm to discover a new set of rules and symbols, a new game to play: they must\ncompete using wealth as a symbol of status. Their indoctrination will be\ndelicate but emphatic: ‘the culture will pressure you in many subtle ways to\nreplace your values with the system’s’. During a lawyer’s first month, a\nsenior partner will invite them to a barbecue. They’ll travel up a long drive,\npark by ranks of luxury cars and walk up a long verdant drive towards an\nenormous house. Someone in a black bow tie will answer the door. In a perfect,\nhuge garden, they’ll be served pâté, shrimp, miniature quiches and cocktails.\nA caterer will grill swordfish. And in the corner they’ll glimpse ‘the senior\npartner, sipping a glass of white wine, holding court with a worshipful group\nof junior partners and senior associates. The senior partner will be wearing\ndesigner sunglasses and designer clothes; the logo on his shirt will signal\nits exorbitant cost; his shorts will be pressed. He will have a tan – albeit a\nslightly orange, tanning salon enhanced tan – and the nicest haircut you’ve\never seen.’\n\nIn this and ‘a thousand other ways’ they’ll begin absorbing the lawyer’s game.\n‘It is very difficult for a young lawyer immersed in this culture day after\nday to maintain the values she had as a law student. Slowly, almost\nimperceptibly, young lawyers change. They begin to admire things they did not\nadmire before, be ashamed of things they were not ashamed of before, find it\nimpossible to live without things they lived without before. Somewhere,\nsomehow, a lawyer changes from a person who gets intense pleasure from being\nable to buy her first car stereo to a person enraged over a $400,000 bonus.’\n\nBut there’s a problem: if these young lawyers are already working as hard as\nit’s possible to work – and they are – how can they get the edge? In order to\nwin, they’ll begin to cheat in ways that seem, at first, excusable. They’ll\nbill a client for ninety minutes for a job that took an hour, but promise to\nrepay them that half an hour another time – it’s not stealing, it’s borrowing.\nAnd they’ll do it, they’ll repay. But then they’ll stop repaying. They’ll tell\nthemselves they did such good work that their client should ‘pay a bit more\nfor it’. They’ll start lying to get an edge too: an excuse over a missed\ndeadline here, a document that’s unhelpful to their client getting ‘lost’\nthere.\n\nA couple of years in and they won’t notice they’re continually lying, cheating\nand stealing. ‘You will still be making dozens of quick, instinctive decisions\nevery day, but those decisions, instead of reflecting the notions of right and\nwrong by which you conduct your personal life, will instead reflect the set of\nvalues by which you will conduct your professional life – a set of values that\nembodies not what is right or wrong, but what is profitable, and what you can\nget away with. The system will have succeeded in replacing your values with\nthe system’s values, and the system will be profiting as a result.’\n\nAs we grow into adults, that system – that game – gains enormous power to\nshape who we become. We mould ourselves to its rules and symbols.",

We mould ourselves to its rules and symbols. As we move\nthrough our days, our identity shifts depending on which game we happen to be\nplaying. We can be an architect at work, a mother at home, a campaigner\nonline, an authority on Charlotte Brontë at the book group, a restorer of\nrocket launchers in the shed – and in each case, we can hope to feel good at\nthese roles: competent, better than him and her and getting better still. Our\nsense of self attaches to each game, an alien funnel implanting itself into an\norganism of many and sucking out what it needs. Our individuality merges with\nthe game and becomes blurred, our moral behaviour and perception of reality\nderanging itself in its service. This is what our adult identity adds up to.\nWe are the sum of the games we play.\n\n\n[16](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos5375)\n\n[Believing the Dream](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos5375)\n\nTHE STORY WE like to tell about humanity speaks of a heroic journey of\nprogress. It’s the arrow of history, the footsteps in the sand, the holy fate\nof us all. There’s evidence for this view everywhere: in rapidly advancing\nscience, technology and living standards. In the last 500 years, we’ve been\nthrough a scientific revolution and an ‘enlightenment’: great intellectual\nmovements that led to the wonders of modernity and showed the irrational\nbeliefs of old to be false. There’s no reason, anymore, to cling to mad ideas.\nSo why do billions still cling? Why do we remain superstitious, gullible and\nreligious? The persistence of irrationality is a puzzle. But the status game\nsuggests an explanation. Humans aren’t heroes on wondrous journeys of\nprogress, we’re players programmed for games. To succeed in these games, we\nseek high-status allies. When we find them, our copy-flatter-conform circuitry\nswitches on. We mimic not just their behaviour but their beliefs. The better\nwe believe, the higher we rise. And so faith, not truth, is incentivised.\n\nIt’s by this process that we come upon many of our most deeply held\nconvictions. It can feel like we choose our beliefs as a cook chooses a\nrecipe, carefully considering an array of options before making a selection.\nBut usually, we believe what our groups believe, obediently copying the\nperceptions of our elites and accepting the world as they define it. This is\nhow status games are played and how human culture has to work. We can’t be\nexpected to test for ourselves every fact on which we have to rely, so instead\nwe look upwards for guidance. We have faith. We believe. And sometimes we end\nup believing crazy things.\n\n[Maranda Dynda knows this](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos793878).

She asked a series of standard questions – How far along\nare you? How’ve you been feeling? Have you put any thought into cribs? – and\nthen she asked, ‘Have you considered not vaccinating?’\n\n‘I didn’t know what she meant,’ Maranda told me. ‘Vaccinating is just a thing\nyou do. You go to the doctor, you get your shots. It’s like paying your\nelectric bill or putting gas in your car. So this was like her saying, “Have\nyou ever not put gas in your car? Have you thought about doing that?”’\n\n‘I don’t know what you’re asking me,’ she told the midwife.\n\nMaranda sat and listened as a wild new dream of reality emerged in front of\nher, right there in her living room. The midwife said after she’d vaccinated\nher first child it was like night and day – bam! – he got vaccinated and he\nwas autistic. The light just left his eyes. And did Maranda know vaccines\ncould give kids diabetes? And they can make it appear that you’ve beaten them\nup? That’s one of the side effects. Child abuse, it looks like. So child\nservices might take your baby away. ‘Anyway,’ she finished. ‘You should make\nup your own mind. It’s totally up to you. There’s some great information on\nGoogle.’\n\nAfter the midwife left, Maranda investigated. She used Google because that’s\nwhat she’d been told. She typed: ‘Why not vaccinate?’ And there it all was:\nbreakdowns, from A-Z, on the ingredients in vaccines and why they’re\ndangerous; blogs detailing how children developed epilepsy and died following\nvaccinations; videos about ‘big pHARMa’ and the cash premiums doctors are paid\nfor poisoning babies. She clicked on the website of Dr Joseph Mercola, a ‘New\nYork Times Bestselling Author’ and winner of the Ultimate Wellness Game\nChanger Award. It looked professional. Serious. MERCOLA: TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR\nHEALTH. At the time of writing, its main story announced: ‘Kids Given Vaccines\nHave 22 Times the Rate of Ear Infections, 32 times the rate of sinusitis, 4x\nallergies, 2x asthma, 4x hayfever, 3x ADHD and 19 times higher odds of Autism\nbased on this 7,850 person survey. Yet 98% of parents give it to their\nchildren.’\n\nThen Maranda looked on Facebook. ‘Facebook was the big one,’ she said. ‘You\nfind a Facebook group, join it and it sucks you in.’ One of the groups was\nGreat Mothers Questioning Vaccines. She made her first comment, announcing\nherself as ‘vaccine hesitant’. It didn’t take long. The group massed around\nher like a slug on an earthworm. ‘I was bombarded: “I was a nurse and I saw\nvaccines do harm”; “I have five kids, I vaccinated the first one and they’re\nlike this”; “I’ve been doing research for thirty-five years.”’ Maranda felt\nfascinated and horrified by their stories. But she also felt good. As an\n18-year-old whose friends were all at college, she had no mothers to talk to,\nbesides her own. ‘It felt warm and cosy.’\n\nBut Maranda’s seduction into the group didn’t only take the form of the\nrewards of connection. ‘I tend to really respect strong, confident women,’ she\nsaid. ‘I grew up in a family of women.

And I thought, look at all these\nmothers, these experienced women I’m surrounded by! They’re so much smarter\nthan me. I don’t know what I’m doing and they all know what they’re doing. It\nwas like – imagine you’re a little kid who wants to be a firefighter and you\nvisit a fire station and you see all the big, strong firefighters and they’re\nreally good at it. You think, I want to be just like them. I wanted to be a\ncool, strong Mom who takes this knowledge I’ve suddenly gained and uses it for\nmy benefit, my child’s benefit, the world’s benefit.’\n\nHer indoctrination was rapid. She played that slot machine for status and kept\non winning. ‘You’re socially rewarded for going with the group,’ she said.\n‘It’s Facebook likes, it’s comments like “yeah way to go Mom, you’re so\nstrong, you’re so smart, you’re doing the best thing” – going to a young Mom\nfrom women who are sometimes older than my Mom.’ She found the experience\n‘captivating. There was also the thing of – this is happening and we need to\ndo something about it. So we were rallying the forces. It felt political.’\n\nSoon, Maranda was out in the world, playing a virtue game, evangelising her\nnew beliefs. She told her mother and her cousins. She began looking for any\nreason to raise the topic socially. ‘You want to bring it up with people you\ncan argue with, because you want to be like, I’m smarter than you, I know more\nthan you do, look at this thing I know that you don’t. It’s really\nembarrassing to think about now. I thought I knew it all. I thought, that’s\ngoing to show them, they’re going to really regret arguing with me.’\n\nI asked Maranda if part of the point was to go back to the group and report\nin, for status rewards. ‘That’s absolutely accurate,’ she said. ‘And that went\nfor everybody: “I went to the doctor’s today and boy did I show them.” “I went\nto my cousin’s today and I was spittin’ fire.” You were rewarded for that. The\nlouder you were, the more unmovable you were, the higher you moved up\nsocially. You became someone for other people to try to strive to be like.\nYou’d look at them and you’d think, they’re so confident in everything they’re\nsaying, they believe it so strongly, they’re willing to do anything. I need to\nbecome this. I think it’s an unconscious thing. Humans want to be revered.\nThey want to be on top of the group.’\n\nAfter she gave birth, Maranda refused to vaccinate her daughter. ‘Please\nrespect my opinions,’ she told her doctor. ‘Thank you very much.’ But over the\nnext two years, she began to feel discomfited by some of the other fringe\nbeliefs expressed by her co-players. She’d always prided herself on being\nrationally minded and would read science textbooks for fun as a child: ‘I’d\nalways loved and trusted science with everything in my being.’ It was this\nrebellious counter-identity that would save her. She’d believed her anti-vax\nstance was based on evidence. But she learned some of the mothers thought the\nonly reason people were gay was because of vaccines. Then someone said AIDS\ndidn’t exist. Then someone warned they were all going to be put in FEMA death\ncamps. ‘Every time I saw these comments I thought, what the hell is that?’ she\nsaid.",

This time, she purposefully looked for information that\ncountered her biases. She also considered the role mainstream medicine played\nin her life. ‘I have asthma, my father’s disabled, there are medical issues\nrampant in my family. I would’ve died from asthma if not for medicine. I was\nsuddenly putting the pieces together.’\n\nShe quietly left her Facebook groups. She arranged for her daughter, who was\nthen 2, to be vaccinated. When she signed up to the pro-vaccines page, Voices\nfor Vaccines, they asked if a blog could be written about her experience. This\nis how her former co-players learned of her betrayal. ‘The blog blew up. It\nwas one of their most read posts ever. It was getting shared around anti-\nvaccine groups.’ And so, as inevitable as night, came the hate. ‘The same\npeople who’d told me I was the best Mom in the world told me I was a piece-of-\ngarbage Mom. There were women who’d supported me so strongly during my very\ndifficult birth who then were like, “you should’ve died in labour.”’ Elite\nfigures with whom she’d never communicated sent messages saying her daughter\nwould grow up to hate her and become ‘retarded’.\n\nShe could imagine what they were saying back on the Facebook group. ‘It was\ncommon to make posts about people like me and say “wow what an idiot”. They’d\nall mob up in mutual hate for them.’ They found it impossible to understand\nwhy anyone would leave them: in their brain-generated fantasy of reality, they\nwere obviously just better than everyone else. ‘They think they’re smarter.\nThey think everyone else is in the system and they’re beating the system. They\nthink they love their children more.’ And why not? Who wouldn’t want to be one\nof the Great Mothers Questioning Vaccines? Who would want to harm their\nchildren?\n\nMaranda was seduced into irrationality by a coalition of high-status Moms who\npulled her into their dream of life with their rewards of the great prize. She\nbecame possessed by the game, evangelising it to all who knew her, risking her\nbaby’s health. Her desire to be a good mother came to depend on the belief\nthat vaccines were harmful. Achieving the latter meant believing the former,\nplaying their game and winning, for my benefit, my child’s benefit, the\nworld’s benefit.

During the Stone\nAge, it didn’t matter if the stories we told about the world weren’t true.\nFaith in the myths and prejudices of our tribe served to bond us together, co-\nordinate our behaviour and motivate us to fight harder against enemies. But in\nthe twenty-first century environment, in which we exist side by side in\nmultiple intertwined and overlapping groups, the human tendency to credulously\naccept the wild dreams of our game leads all too frequently to error,\nmistrust, division, aggression, hubris and catastrophe. And the tendency is\nstrong.\n\nPsychologists have amassed a sizeable literature that demonstrates how even\nour closest convictions are often absorbed from our games. This is true of our\npolitical beliefs. In one study, researchers who altered the apparent policies\nof the Republicans and Democrats found voters changed their support for harsh\nor lavish welfare programmes accordingly. Not only did they not realise they\nwere being manipulated, they found good reasons to support their altered\nbeliefs and could readily explain how they’d come to them. Psychologist Dr\nLilliana Mason writes, ‘more often than not, citizens do not choose which\nparty to support based on policy opinion; they alter their policy opinion\naccording to which party they support. Usually they do not notice that this is\nhappening, and most, in fact, feel outraged when the possibility is\nmentioned.’\n\nOur brain has various tricks that nudge us into accepting our game’s story of\nthe world and believing what it’s supposed to: it tells us the [members of our\ngroup](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos794733) are more intelligent than\nothers; it finds it [harder to reason\nlogically](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos795096) over arguments that\ncontradict our group’s beliefs; it [processes opinions we\nalready](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos795529) agree with as if they’re\nfacts; it often automatically assumes those who hold different beliefs are\n[stupider, more biased, less\nmoral](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos795970) and less trustworthy than\nwe are, making it all too easy to dismiss them.\n\nAnd intelligence is no inoculation. On the contrary. When brilliant people are\nmotivated to find evidence to support their group’s false beliefs, they’re\nbrilliant at finding it. Their superior intelligence simply makes them better\nat reaffirming their bent story of reality. [When psychologists study\nhow](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos796398) people’s religious, political\nand social identities affect their beliefs, they find that the more educated,\nnumerate and intelligent they are, the more likely they are to endorse the\nfringe ideas of their groups. This goes for deniers of climate change,\nvaccination and evolution – the smarter a player is, the greater the\nlikelihood they’ll reject scientific consensus. We’re all vulnerable to\nbelieving what our coalition wants us to believe. For anthropologist Professor\nJohn Tooby, ‘[Coalition\nmindedness](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos796716) makes everyone,\nincluding scientists, far stupider in coalitional collectivities than as\nindividuals.’\n\nNeedless to say, we’re not entirely gullible. When the facts of a matter are\nstrong and we devote sincere conscious effort to understanding them, we can be\nperfectly capable of rationality. Personal experiences can throw us out of our\nbubble. There are also categories of beliefs we can accept without a struggle,\nmany of them objectively measurable and devoid of status value, such as the\nlength of the Mississippi River. If we don’t endlessly debate these kinds of\nfacts, it’s because we don’t have any of our status invested in them. But,\nwhen we do, our thinking can rapidly become deranged.\n\nIn the places where status is won and lost, we can be vulnerable to believing\nalmost anything.",

Personal experiences can throw us out of our\nbubble. There are also categories of beliefs we can accept without a struggle,\nmany of them objectively measurable and devoid of status value, such as the\nlength of the Mississippi River. If we don’t endlessly debate these kinds of\nfacts, it’s because we don’t have any of our status invested in them. But,\nwhen we do, our thinking can rapidly become deranged.\n\nIn the places where status is won and lost, we can be vulnerable to believing\nalmost anything. Billions play games in the fantastic dreamworlds conjured by\nthe great religions: Christians believe evil was introduced to the world as a\npunishment from God after a woman ate an apple; Muslims believe angels were\ncreated on a Wednesday and walk the earth noting down believers’ good and bad\nacts; Jews believe they’re a chosen people selected by God to be a ‘light unto\nnations’; Hindus believe eternal souls travel through cycles of birth and\nrebirth that only cease when a state of perfection is achieved; Jehovah’s\nWitnesses believe it’s better to die than receive blood transfusions, which\nare against God’s will; Buddhists believe there are thirty-one planes of\nexistence, including the ‘realm of hungry ghosts’, through which the\nreincarnated ascend, depending on how well they play their game; Sikh men wear\nspecial pants to control their lust and believe hair is God’s creation so must\nnever be cut.\n\nOf course, not all modern adherents believe such stories. Some take their more\nincredible details as metaphorical whilst accepting their underlying\nsupernatural claims. But that [84 per cent\nof](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos796963) the world’s population\nidentifies as religious shows the game’s capacity to flood our minds with\nstrange notions: our compulsion to seek schemes that make connection and\nstatus and weave wild dreams around them. And there’s no reason for\nunbelievers to feel superior. Atheists are often born and educated in a place\nwhere their particular values are considered pre-eminent, and their particular\nicons deferred to. What’s true for them is true for everyone. Most of the\ntime, we don’t check for ourselves what’s true, we check with our elites. We\nbelieve what we’re supposed to.\n\nThis even counts for the most precious of our beliefs, the ones we categorise\nas ‘moral’. The moral reality we live in is a virtue game. We use our displays\nof morality to manufacture status. It’s good that we do this. It’s functional.\n[It’s why](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos797328) billionaires fund\nlibraries, university scholarships and scientific endeavours; it’s why a study\nof 11,672 organ donations in the USA found only thirty-one were made\nanonymously. It’s why we feel good when we commit moral acts and thoughts\nprivately and enjoy the approval of our imaginary audience. Virtue status is\nthe bribe that nudges us into putting the interests of other people –\nprincipally our co-players – before our own.\n\nWe treat moral beliefs as if they’re universal and absolute: one study found\n[people were more likely](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos797589) to\nbelieve God could change physical laws of the universe than he could moral\n‘facts’.

But these instructions – strive to\nappear virtuous; privilege your group over others – are few and vague and open\nto riotous differences in interpretation. All the rest is an act of shared\nimagination. It’s a dream we weave around a status game.\n\nThe dream shifts as we range across the continents.

Securing connection was as easy as believing. But to\nearn status, a player had to do more than merely agree. They had to become\npossessed by the belief, defending it, evangelising it, acting it out in their\nlife. The more they allowed the belief to take them over, the higher they\nclimbed. Much of the groupish tumult we see in the world is fuelled by these\ndynamics. And status is a fuel like no other. Whereas coal, gas and oil are\ncostly to produce and in limited supply, status just goes on and on and on –\nyet is hardly less flammable. When status games form around an irrational\nbelief they can grow breathtakingly large, spreading gibberish, mayhem and\nagony across the continents.\n\nDuring the 1980s, status games began mining rewards for players in the belief\nthat there were secret, powerful networks of satanic paedophiles running\ndaycare centres in the USA. This was an era that had seen the spectacular rise\nin the status games of the psychotherapists and social workers, especially\nthose focussed on child abuse. Previous decades had been dominated by Freudian\ntheories that tended to dismiss adult recollections of abuse as fantasies. As\nsuch, its appalling realities were often ignored.

One of their authors,\nfeminist activist [Louise Armstrong, has\nsince](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos800904) written of the ‘staggering\narray of clinicians and counsellors and therapists and researchers and\nauthorities and experts’ that emerged at the time, ‘all with their careers\nsighted on one aspect or another’ of child abuse.\n\nThe 1980s also saw the ecstatic resurgence of conservative Christian games,\nfollowing the ideological beatings they’d taken during the 1960s and 1970s, as\nthe sexual revolution and equality-focussed second-wave feminists attacked\ntheir ideas about the central importance of traditional family life. The\nelection of Ronald Reagan helped them rediscover their power as a dominant\ncultural force. And, to their horror, by the start of the 1980s, 45 per cent\nof American women were working outside the home, many dropping their children\noff to be looked after by near-strangers at daycare centres. To the\nconservative Christians, these were the victories of Satan.\n\nThe Christians’ war on Satan and the therapists’ war on child abuse were to\ncome together in unholy conjugation in 1980, in the pages of a bestselling\nbook. Michelle Remembers was a supposedly true account of childhood satanic\nritual abuse, written by the victim’s psychiatrist, Dr Lawrence Pazder.\nAmongst other things, Michelle claimed to have been raped by satanists,\nsmeared with blood and excrement and forced to assist in the murder of another\nchild with a crucifix; doctors who were members of the cult took the then-\ninfant Michelle to an operating theatre and surgically implanted horns and a\ntail onto her body. The abuse culminated in an eighty-one-day ritual in which\nSatan himself turned up, only for Jesus, Mary and Michael the Archangel to\narrive and conveniently remove the physical scars left by her abuse. [Pazder\ntold journalists, ‘](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos801204)In the\nbeginning I wondered if she had made things up. But if this is a hoax, it\nwould be the most incredible hoax ever.’\n\nPazder’s book earned $342,000 in advance money alone and was publicised with\nfull-page newspaper advertisements. It set him on a thirty-nine-day publicity\ntour of America. He became a superstar in the wildly blooming abuse-busting\ntherapeutic world, travelling up and down the nation educating mental health\nclinicians and law enforcement officers about the threat satanists posed. It\nwas at an early event, during a presentation to the prestigious American\nPsychiatric Association, that Pazder introduced the term ‘ritual abuse’.\n\nThe Satanic Panic was fuelled by status games. They were formed wherever\nbelievers gathered, in conferences, seminars, training sessions and\norganisations such as the Preschool-Age Molested Children’s Professional\nGroup, Children’s Institute International and the National Center for Child\nAbuse and Neglect. [A survey of\nmore](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos801486) than two thousand\npsychologists, psychiatrists and social workers who worked with ritual abuse\ncases found they ‘had a very high rate of attending lectures, seminars or\nworkshops concerned with ritualistic crime or ritualistic abuse’.

Next,\ntrainee players would be lured with the promise of major virtue status by\ntheir battling of what psychiatrist [Dr Roland Summit\ndescribed](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos801755) as, ‘the most serious\nthreat to children and to society that we must face in our lifetime’. They\nwere taught rules like [the ‘Rule\nof](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos802061) P’s’ – professions most likely\nto harbour satanists included providers of daycare, physicians, psychiatrists,\nprincipals and teachers, police, politicians, priests, public officials and\npallbearers. Elite players would then lead group discussion sessions during\nwhich stray doubters were dealt with; impediments to consensus made quiet.\n\nAt training sessions, they’d have further lessons in playing the Satan-hunting\ngame. Rule number one was ‘believe the children’. According to Summit, [‘the\nmore illogical](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos802319) and incredible’\nthe testimony of a child, the ‘more likely’ it was to be true. And if they\nchanged their mind and told you, actually, they made it all up, that’s ‘the\nnormal course’ and exactly to be expected: such denials were evidence of the\nsatanists’ genius for mind control. Indeed, ‘very few children, no more than\ntwo or three per thousand, have ever been found to exaggerate or to invent\nclaims of sexual molestation’. Believe the Children became a sacred belief for\nthe Satan-hunters; the rule that defined their game. They wore it on lapel\nbadges; activist parents formed the Believe The Children Organisation. It\n[‘became the banner](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos802694) of that\ndecade’, writes sociologist Professor Mary de Young, ‘and those who marched\nunder it were of a single mind that no allegation of sexual abuse was\nunbelievable [and] no retraction or denial was acceptable’.\n\nSpecial methods were taught for gathering evidence from children. Clues that\nritual abuse had been inflicted included: [fear of the\ndark](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos802967); fear of dying; poor\nattention span; fear of aggressive animals and low self-esteem. Children would\nhave their anuses examined [with a\n‘wink](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos803218) response test’: a swab was\ntouched near the anus, if it spontaneously opened, that meant abuse. Infant\ngirls would have a magnifying camera called a colposcope inserted into them,\nwith which an examiner would seek out the tiniest scars, abrasions, and blood\nvessel disturbances, as well as minute variations in the size and shape of\ntheir hymens. These were ‘microtraumas’, said the Satan-hunters. Even though\ninvisible to the naked eye, microtraumas were evidence of abuse.\n\nOther evidence came from interviews with children.

You must be dumb.’ In another, a 5-year-old boy\nrepeatedly told MacFarlane he never saw the accused daycare staff do anything\n‘bad’.\n\n[‘You’re](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos804321) just afraid,’ she told\nhim.\n\n‘No I’m not.’\n\n‘You’re just a scaredy cat. How come you won’t tell me?’\n\nAs this case suggests, interviewers exploited children’s natural desire for\nstatus to persuade them to give the ‘right’ answers. One was encouraged by\nbeing told, ‘You’re an absolute trooper, I think you’re almost a man.’ In\nanother MacFarlane said to a girl named Kristie, ‘We know there were naked\ngames at your preschool.’ She looked at the girl’s hand-puppet. ‘Do you\nremember that, bear?’ When the girl shook the bear’s head to say ‘no’,\nMacFarlane said, ‘Oh, bear! Maybe you don’t have a very good memory. Your\nmemory must not be as good as Kristie’s friend’s memories.’ One former\ninterviewee recalled [being rewarded with\npraise](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos804606) for lying about being\nabused by his father. ‘If I brought something that seemed like it was moving\nthings forward, or affirming something, I definitely felt like something was\naccomplished, for sure. I didn’t want to be the idiot kid who couldn’t\nremember anything. And then they tell you, “You’re doing a good job”.’\n\nHaving been taught the game at conferences, seminars and workshops, many\nhundreds of mental health professionals returned to their communities to begin\nplaying at finding their own evidence of ritual abuse. Adhering to the sacred\nrule of believe the children, no claim proved too insane.

[‘Abundant\nwith clinical](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos805053) terms and concepts,\nsparse on empirical data, bereft of theory,’ writes de Young, it helped\nparents ‘make sense’ of their children’s behaviour. One mother testified at\ntrial that these ideas helped her realise that her child’s repeated denials\nanything bad had happened were actually signals that it had.\n\nStatus flooded into these games by many routes, not least proximity to\nprestigious governmental bodies and glittering rivers of cash. [In 1984 the\nJustice](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos805322) Department financed a\nfour-day conference that brought together eighty-five elite names. Following\ncongressional hearings the same year, which included testimony from players\nsuch as superstar child interviewer Kee MacFarlane, Congress doubled its\nfunding for child protection programmes to $158 million over four years, to\nwhich $25 million was quickly added for training for day-care staff, so they\ncould better detect and prevent abuse. In 1984, NCCAN’s budget more than\nquadrupled and included a $146,000 payment to Kee MacFarlane for a set of\nchild interviews. By 1985 its annual budget for research and demonstration\ngrants had grown to nearly $14 million. They awarded one grant to an employee\nof a state mental health department, to study children at a preschool in\nNiles, Michigan. The kids had apparently been abused in a church and in\ntunnels, been buried in the ground, engaged in blood rituals, had objects\ninserted into their genitals and been threatened with sharks. NCCAN’s payment\nto the researcher for a ‘followup study’ on the children was $449,000.\n\nThe law enforcement establishment were also incentivised to believe the\nmovement’s dreams to be credible and true. These included ambitious, often\nconservative-Christian district attorneys, who’d been elected on promises to\nprioritise child protection and zealous police officers who’d been tempted\ninto the game at the same events as the therapists and social workers. These\ncops, writes [former officer Robert\nHicks](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos805605), ‘attend a few cult\nseminars, return to their departments, and organise portfolios of satanalia so\nthat they themselves can give seminars to teachers, parents, and enforcers;\nthey join informal networks of other cult cops, then parade their own\nconsciousness-raising seminars’. With their status being engorged by active\nbelief in these allegations, police and prosecutors proved no less credulous\nthan the mental health workers.

In Manhattan Beach,\nCalifornia, [one daycare centre\nwas](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos807054) pelted with eggs, had its\nwindows smashed and was set on fire, its outer walls graffitied: ONLY THE\nBEGINNING and DEAD. [Parents dug in\nits](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos807317) grounds searching for a\nsecret labyrinth of tunnels. When unsuccessful, the district attorney hired a\nfirm of archaeologists to assist. When they too were unsuccessful, the parents\nhired their own archaeologists. Nobody found any tunnels. Nevertheless a\nsurvey of that community found 98 per cent thought one of the accused, Ray\nBuckey, was [‘definitely or\nprobably](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos807578) guilty’ with 93 per cent\nthinking the same of Peggy McMartin-Buckey; 80 per cent had ‘no doubt’ of\ntheir guilt. [When she was\nbailed](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos807848), following twenty-two\nmonths of pretrial detention, Peggy was shunned, received late-night telephone\ndeath threats and was verbally and physically assaulted.\n\n[Their case alone cost](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos808124) $15\nmillion dollars to bring and was, at the time, the longest and most expensive\ncriminal trial in US history. They were ultimately acquitted. Meanwhile, those\nclosely involved with the accusations, [writes de Young,\n‘](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos808399)took to the national conference,\nlecture, consultancy and expert testimony circuit’ where they ‘recruited\nothers who, in turn, went on to find cases of daycare ritual abuse in their\nown communities and then trained others still to do the same in their\ncommunities’. And so the game continued to reproduce itself, its unholy dream\ncaptivating more and more people. Most recruits to the Satan-hunting game\n‘trace their interest … [to this small\ncadre](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos808688) of moral entrepreneurs’.\n\nDuring this period, [190 people were\nformally](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos808971) charged in ritual abuse\ncases and at least eighty-three convicted.

Instead, police and\nprosecutors relied upon debunked and invented tests for winking anuses and\nmicrotraumas and the coerced and literally unbelievable testimony of children.\nThese events, writes de Young, constituted a [‘triumph of\nideology](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos809844) over science’. And the\nrole that the status games of conferences, seminars and training sessions\nplayed in it all [‘may actually\nbe](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos810117) difficult to overestimate’.\n\nIf the small original cadre of Satan-hunters had been motivated to solve the\nproblem of ritual abuse, they’d have played a success game. In success games,\nstatus is awarded principally for displays of competence. They make for a\nculture of analysis, experimentation, practice, research, testing, revision,\ndata and open debate. A success game approach to the riddance of secret sex-\nsatanists could be expected to start with a useful assessment of the problem.\nThis would’ve led to the realisation it didn’t exist. The consequence? Not\nmuch status for the Satan-hunters.\n\nInstead, they played a virtue game. Virtue games often do weave a story around\ntheir striving that says they are motivated by the solving of some critical\nproblem – frequently in the form of some evil, high-status enemy – but the\ntruth is betrayed by their mode of play. Virtue games tend to be focussed\nmostly on the promotion of the game itself, with maintenance of conformity,\ncorrect beliefs and behaviours being of heightened importance. The hunters’\ncore beliefs were often challenged by children in interviews and their virtue\nplay is evident in their magicking of these denials into further evidence that\ntheir diseased perception of reality was correct. They were willing to\n‘believe the children’, but only when the children confirmed their beliefs.\nThe consequence? Status beyond their wildest dreams.\n\nOf course, it’s not impossible that some of these cases could’ve had abuse at\ntheir core. [Political scientist Dr\nRoss](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos810399) Cheit has even gone so far\nas to argue most defendants were probably guilty. [But\nCheit’s](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos810679) thesis has come under\nserious criticism from academics and journalists who accuse him of omissions\nand distortions. For instance, Cheit believes there was ‘substantial evidence’\nagainst the Kellers, including the testimony of Dr Michael Mouw, who told the\ncourt he’d found physical evidence of abuse in a 3-year-old girl. However,\nthis evidence appears to belong to the dubious category of the microtrauma:\n[in 2013 Mouw testified](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos811685) he’d\nsince learned more about female genitalia and now had ‘no doubt’ her hymen was\nnormal.

It should’ve been obviously\ntrue these children weren’t having their eyes stapled shut and being tossed at\nsharks. It seems barely possible that so many people had their lives ruined by\nthe magnificently wacky dream the Satan-hunters wove. But to the vaguely\ninterested onlooker, following the events mostly via headlines and talkshows,\nsome measure of credulity is understandable. After all, the people making the\nallegations were high-status figures who spoke at conferences and wrote for\nnewspapers and authored academic papers and were interviewed by Oprah. They\nknew what they were talking about. Their claims were supported by other high-\nstatus figures, such as police officers and prosecutors, and numerous\nconvictions had been won. Everyone knew child abuse was the most urgent moral\ncrisis facing America, and that all those poor suffering children had, for so\nlong, been ignored. Who could be against believing the children? Who could be\nagainst fighting abuse?\n\nThe greater puzzle sits with the warrior evangelists who drove the events, and\ninvested a significant measure of their personal status in their being true.\nWhen the tale is recounted as briefly as this, it’s easy to miss that some of\nthese cases lasted years and were worked on intensely by any number of\nprofessional adults. Police forces diligently and repeatedly searched for\nsecret tunnels, sacrificed babies and mutilated animals. Checks and balances,\nboth institutional and in the individual intelligence of those involved,\nfailed and failed and kept on failing. Most of the players who conspired to\ntake the innocent carers down – psychiatrists, therapists, doctors, social\nworkers, police officers, journalists – ought to have been incentivised to\nfind the facts. And yet they were not only often utterly credulous, but\nrigidly insistent of their truth, evangelising it all the way to the slamming\nof the cell door.\n\nThe standard account of human life struggles to make sense of this. Either\nthese warriors were brave heroes striving to make the world a better place or\nthey were lying, scheming villains gladly sacrificing the innocent. Neither\noption is credible. The Satan-hunters were simply doing what nature had\nprogrammed them to do. Their brains detected a game that offered fantastic\nrewards: connection with like-minded others and status in the form of\ninfluence, acclaim, cash, fame, proximity to the prestigious games of law,\nmedia and government and the reputation of an avenging angel, defending the\nlives of America’s children. And so they played. They believed the dream and\nthey believed it sincerely. Of course they did. They were only human.\n\nEvents like these are often described as moral panics. Whilst this is surely\ncorrect in some cases, our investigation suggests an alternative possibility:\nthat much of their explosive energy can derive not from panic, but desire for\nacclaim. They happen when games suddenly find ways of generating outsized\nvolumes of status for their players. When a rich seam is discovered, more and\nmore individuals are attracted to the game, with a precondition for play being\nacceptance of its beliefs, no matter how unlikely. Status is earned with\nactive belief. As the games grow, and suck in satellite games around them,\ntheir beliefs come to seem increasingly mainstream. More players playing means\nmore status being generated, and so the game’s sucking power becomes more\nmonstrous still, and so on and so on in a runaway process, the whole thing\nbecoming self-sustaining, self-expanding, with it eventually becoming\nsufficiently massive to be felt right across the culture. In such scenarios,\nthe status on offer can become vast and almost irresistibly seductive.\nIndividual players transmute from being ordinary people living ordinary lives\nto becoming mighty and noble changers of worlds.\n\nIf there’s a warning from this, it’s that we should be suspicious of any idea,\nsuch as ‘believe children’ or ‘vaccines are harmful’, that allows connection\ninto a game. We should be yet more suspicious when status, in that game, is\nearned by active belief in it.",

We should be yet more suspicious when status, in that game, is\nearned by active belief in it. This is what happened during the Satanic Panic\nand it’s what Maranda Dynda experienced in the world of the vaccine deniers\nand it’s what drove the men of Pohnpei to devote their lives to the growing of\nmassive yams. When people accept a core belief and act on it, as the price for\nearning connection and status, they allow themselves to become possessed. That\nbelief is now a status symbol. As their hallucination of reality bends itself\naround it, they become its host and crusader, deranged and impossible to\nreason with. In short, their belief has become sacred.\n\nThere are many definitions of what ‘sacred’ means, but from the perspective of\nthis investigation, something is sacred when it becomes symbolic of our status\ngame. As we’ve learned, the entire world as we experience it inside our brains\nis built out of symbols. This is the virtual interface on which we play the\ngame of life. A Casio and a Cartier watch are both symbolic, signalling\ndifferent volumes of status. But some phenomena can become symbolic not just\nof an amount of status, but of a status game itself. They might be flags,\nbuildings, battle sites, uniforms, gang colours, ceremonies, books, songs,\nphrases, or the images, remains or birthplaces of elite players, living or\ndead. Leaders can become sacred. Perhaps the ultimate sacred symbol is the\nmonotheistic God: the all-powerful creator and referee of his status game.\n\nBeliefs can become sacred too. They frequently do. This is why our reasoning\nabout our sacred beliefs can become so impaired. [‘When a\ngroup](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos812460) of people make something\nsacred,’ writes the psychologist Professor Jonathan Haidt, they ‘lose the\nability to think clearly about it.’ Beliefs are like my Mötley Crüe T-shirt,\nonly infinitely more dangerous.\n\nSacred symbols can be seen as physical carriers of our status: when someone\nattacks them, they attack our game and our co-playing kin; they degrade all\nthat we’ve earned and all that we value. They scorn our dream of reality, our\nlived experience, and the ways we think and act in it in order to feel\nsuperior. This is why beliefs can make us irrational and violent. It’s why\nthey can send us to war.\n\n\n[18](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos5557)\n\n[War Games](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos5557)\n\nIT ALL BEGAN over [lunch by the\nbeach](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos812800) in La Jolla, California.\nThat afternoon, in the autumn of 1984, a counterculture businessman named\nLarry Brilliant tried to hustle a publisher, Stewart Brand, into using his\nonline conferencing technology.

They could create a kind of virtual hippy\ncommune. Who knows what would happen? Wouldn’t it be interesting to find out?\nBrand agreed. He named this experimental community ‘The Whole Earth ’Lectronic\nLink’ – ‘The Well’ for short. [It was launched\nto](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos813444) the public in 1985, on April\nFools’ Day.\n\nBefore The Well, there’d been online bulletin boards and suchlike, relatively\nclosed spaces in which academics and tech nerds could communicate. But there’d\nnever been anything quite like this. All of today’s social media platforms are\nbuilt on the bones of The Well. The contemporary model it resembles most\nclosely is Reddit. Users of The Well would join ‘conferences’, analogous to\nReddit’s ‘subreddits’, arranged around various subjects and chat either\npublicly or via direct messages known as ‘sends’. Writes Well historian Katie\nHafner, [‘The idea was](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos813718) just about\nas simple as it could be: Find a bunch of people who are associated by\nsomething as random as the age of their children or their preference in wine\nor their taste in music, who would take that association seriously; give them\nthe means to stay in continuous communication with each other; and step back\nand see what happens.’\n\nWhat happened was people gathering around these ‘random associations’ and\nforming status games. Players were mostly of a certain type. Hafner describes\nthem as [‘baby boomers in](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos813970) their\nlate thirties and early forties, smart and left-leaning without being self-\nconsciously PC, mostly male, many with postgraduate degrees’. These like minds\n‘found something of a club’ in their online forums: they’d discuss their lives\nand expertise, showing off what they knew. But then, about a year after its\nlaunch, [when user numbers approached five\nhundred](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos814251), someone different\narrived. [His log-in was](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos814512) Grandma,\nhis name Mark Ethan Smith. Unlike his relatively privileged co-players, [Smith\nhad been homeless](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos814748) for around\ntwenty years and was [living in near-\npoverty](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos815082) in Berkeley. And he was\nangry. He hated men. He came to despise the [‘white male\nclan](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos815330)’ he believed characterised\nThe Well.\n\n[Smith would start brutal](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos815638)\n‘flamewars’, making outrageous assertions or attacks on people on the forums,\nin direct messages and multi-hundred-line emails – even on the phone ([‘Smith\nhad a](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos815900) knack for finding people’s\nhome telephone numbers,’ writes Hafner).

He wasn’t trans, he was gender non-conforming\n– [‘I never became](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos818495) a man, nor do\nI wish to be known as a man, or, for that matter as a woman,’ he wrote. ‘In\nthe 5,000 year history of patriarchy, I may be the first individual to exist\nas a person, without regard to sex.’ He objected to having a female name and\npronouns he considered [‘diminutive’,\ninsisting](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos818838) on the ‘right to equal\nterms’ with men. His demands to be referred to as ‘he’ – unusual at that time\n– [were respected by many](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos819214) women\nof The Well and a few of the men. But more found it preposterous. [One\nwrote](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos819562): ‘According to Mark, you\nhave to call me by a name or pronoun of my choice. In the future please refer\nto me as: “THE GRAND PUBA, MASTER OF ALL HE SEES OR THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE\nWHICHEVER IS BIGGER”.’\n\nIt didn’t take long for the organism to begin moving against Smith. As one\nformer member has recalled: [‘The more\ndefined](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos819942) The Well became as a\ncommunity, the more it became aware of itself, and the more it became aware\nthat there were others that were not of it, and the more hostile it became\ntoward them.’ When reason didn’t work, Smith was abused and insulted.

[In an undated\nessay](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos822053) reflecting on his\nexperience, Smith seems most upset at the loss of his contributions. ‘If The\nWell establishment disagreed with my opinions, they could have done so without\ncensoring me.’\n\nWhy did all this happen? When Smith presented ideas they didn’t believe in,\nwhy didn’t they simply ignore him? And when he abused them, why couldn’t they\nignore it? Then, when he was banned, why did they feel the need to erase his\nwork? Why not ignore it? Just forget about it. Why not? Ignoring should be\neasy, it should be the default: it’s literally doing nothing. But in these\nsituations we hardly ever ignore. Because it’s not actually effortless. When\nwe encounter people whose beliefs contradict our own, we can find it acutely\nuncomfortable. We become preoccupied and hateful and flip into dominance\nstate. Our beliefs can even drive us to war.\n\nSuch behaviour can be difficult to understand. What’s the point in getting so\nemotional about a stranger being wrong? It doesn’t make sense. Especially\nsince, as is so often the case, we become furious over issues that have no\nreal-world effect on the lives of us or anyone we know. Of all the things we\ncould be doing with our energies, being angry at the internet seems a worse\nthan pointless choice. So why do we have this reflex? It only makes sense if\nwe adjust our conception of the human condition. Life is a game played with\nsymbols, and beliefs can be no less symbolic than an invader’s battle flag.\n\nOur status games are embedded into our perception. We experience reality\nthrough them. So when we encounter someone playing a rival game, it can be\ndisturbing. If they’re living by a conflicting set of rules and symbols,\nthey’re implying our rules and symbols – our criteria for claiming status –\nare invalid, and our dream of reality is false. They’re a sentient repudiation\nof the value we’ve spent our lives earning. They insult us simply by being who\nthey are. It should be no surprise, then, that encountering someone with\nconflicting beliefs can feel like an attack: status is a resource, and they’re\ntaking it from us. [When neuroscientist Professor\nSarah](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos822359) Gimbel presented forty\npeople with evidence their strongly held political beliefs were wrong, the\nresponse she observed in their brains was ‘very similar to what would happen\nif, say, [you were walking](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos822775)\nthrough the forest and came across a bear’.",

We tend to the wounds that have been torn into our\nhallucination of the world with frantic conversation, medicated with status\ntalk: our foes are ignorant, insane, Nazis, feminazis, white supremacists,\nTERFs, bros, wokes, gammons, Karens, SJWs, arseholes, cunts, dicks, tits,\ncrisp packets blowing in the wind. We jab our fingernails into every crack we\nfind in their dream of reality and, with each one discovered, the threat of\ntheir rival claim to status diminishes as ours is reaffirmed. And so our\nbloodied understanding of life and how it operates is healed; our belief in\nour game and our criteria for earning status is restored, and the thick\nevening sunlight of self-satisfaction is allowed to return.\n\nBut the dream is now becoming dangerous. It takes the differences between us\nand our rivals and weaves over them a moral story that says they’re not simply\nwrong, they’re evil. This permits further vilification. Our perception warps\nand bends as we vindictively examine the actions of our foes, searching for\nany evidence to justify our slide towards dominance. Studies have found this\nin benign situations: in one neuroscience lab, [participants who were\noffered](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos823107) more points for\ndiscriminating blues over reds were, within minutes, better able to see blues.\nBut it also seems common when we’re engaged in judging our rivals.\n[Psychologists had participants\ndecide](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos823394) if protestors in a video\nwere breaking various laws. In one version, they were said to be protesting an\nabortion clinic; in another, it was military recruiting. The participants’\njudgements of the legality of their behaviour depended to a significant degree\non whether or not they appeared to share their moral beliefs. ‘Our subjects\nall viewed the same video,’ wrote the researchers. ‘But what they saw depended\non the congruence of the protestors’ positions with the subjects’ own cultural\nvalues.’\n\nThis vindictive mindset is exemplified in the account of the Communist Dai\nHsaio-Ai who recalled the bullying that children of former bourgeoisie parents\nwould receive at school: ‘Any mistake, whether related to politics or not, was\ncertain to be interpreted in terms of their social class standing. For\nexample, a foul committed on the basketball court might become “[another\nmanifestation of the](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos824018) rich peasant\nmentality”.’ We can always find new reasons to justify our hatreds when our\ndiseased dream of reality keeps imagining them into being.\n\nOur hatreds are further justified by the belief that our status game is not an\nact of shared imagination that’s local to our kin, but real. And if our\ncriteria for claiming status are real, that means everyone should abide by\nthem. We have a spiteful and snobbish habit of judging all people by our\nrules, whether they’re playing with us or not. It’s by this logic that an\nAmerican can look down on a Chinese person who spits in a street, whilst a\nJapanese person can look down on that American for blowing their nose.

If\nthey’re not playing by the imagined rules we’ve decided are important and\ntrue, we give them a plummeting. Psychologist Professor Sam Gosling finds this\nwhen his students cluster into personality groups: [‘the extroverts\ndon](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos824331)’t disguise their disdain for\nthe uncommunicative introverts, who selfishly refuse to keep the discussion\nalive; they cannot fathom why their mute colleagues don’t do their bit to\ncarry some of the conversational load. At the same time, the introverts have\nnothing but contempt for their garrulous counterparts; why not, they wonder,\nwait until you’ve got something worth saying before opening your mouth?’\n\nWe take our foe’s adherence to their own game as proof of their disgrace. When\nthey defend themselves, our brains fight off their rival dream of reality by\nwarping ours further, such that it becomes impossible for them to win. If they\npresent counter arguments, [we often demand\nunreasonably](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos824582) high evidence for\ntheir claims just as we accept unreasonably low evidence for ours. We like to\nfind any excuse to dismiss their strongest arguments and simply forget those\nthat disturb us most. We adopt harsh double standards, extending them none of\nthe patience, understanding and empathy we lavish on our own. As accusation\nand outrage builds, our co-players supply us with ever more reasons why we’re\nright, helping us calm any dissonance generated by our wanting to feel\nvirtuous whilst wanting to cause them pain. We begin to see the individual\nplayers who make up their game as an indistinguishable stain, judging them all\nas identical and identically contemptible. Look at them: they deserve it,\nthey’re asking for it. We attack as a blameless, heroic David fighting the\ncruel monster Goliath. Our kin play their part, cheering us on with every\nperceived victory, flooding us with boosted status until we’re giddy.\n\nWe think of morality as unquestionably good: how could it be otherwise? But\nthe moral rules we abide by are a component of our status game, the dream\nworld in which we exist. This dream can all too easily become a nightmare,\ntricking us into believing our acts of barbarity are holy. As psychologists\nProfessors Steve Reicher and Alex Haslam write: [‘People do\ngreat](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos824937) wrong, not because they are\nunaware of what they are doing but because they consider it to be right. This\nis possible because they actively identify with groups whose ideology\njustifies and condones the oppression and destruction of others.’ Elsewhere\n[anthropologists Professors Alan\nPage](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos825296) Fiske and Tage Shakti Rai\nfind that ‘when people hurt or kill someone, they usually do so because they\nfeel they ought to: they feel that it is morally right or even obligatory to\nbe violent’. When the victim is [‘perceived as\na](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos825658) potential threat or contaminant\nto the in-group’, such acts are seen as ‘morally praiseworthy’.\n\nMost of the time, we don’t fight with violence.

[The Marind of\nSouth](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos826025) New Guinea believed semen\nto be a magical source of strength and fertility; they used it as an ointment\nfor body and hair and mixed it in their food; when spread onto spears, bows\nand fishhooks the semen guided the weapons to their targets. Mostly, this\nmagic semen couldn’t be harvested via masturbation. It had to be mixed with\nvaginal fluid following ritual sex. [The women of\nthe](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos826289) Marind engaged in extremely\nfrequent sexual intercourse, and not only for this purpose: on her wedding\nnight, a woman would have sex with all the men of her new partner’s subclan –\noften as many as a dozen – before getting to her husband. She’d do the same\nfollowing childbirth. These practices were intended to increase fertility.\nInstead, notes anthropologist Professor Robert Paul, they likely ‘had the\nopposite effect’. The combination of frequent sperm harvesting from the men\nand inflammation of the cervix from ‘excessive copulation’ in the women meant\nfertility rates were low and falling.\n\nAnd yet both their population and territory were expanding. They’d achieve\nthis by launching raiding parties into neighbouring lands and kidnapping\nchildren to raise as their own. This is how the Marind kept their game alive.\nThey may not have been reproducing genetically but they were ‘certainly\nreproducing themselves by producing successors, heirs, and bearers of the\ncultural symbolic system passed on to them by their adoptive parents’, writes\nPaul. For the Marind, these stolen children were ‘real descendants – just as\nreal as if they had been biological offspring’.\n\nSocieties like the Marind’s thrive because human identity is fluid and\ncreative. It’s not basic markers such as sex, race or nationality that\nultimately define us, it’s our imagined games. Of course, we can play those\nkinds of games, and often do, but they’re not compulsory. It’s even possible\nto play status games in opposition to our born identity. In recent years a\nnumber of white people in the US have been caught playing ethnic minority\nidentity games, earning status by ‘passing’ dishonestly as black. In 2020, a\nwhite associate professor of African history, Jessica Krug, resigned from her\njob having admitted assuming [‘identities within\na](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos826686) Blackness that I had no right\nto claim’ for the ‘better part’ of her adult life. Krug’s status play included\nanti-white beliefs. During the ensuing scandal, an Afro-Latino man she’d\nbriefly dated told reporters, [‘I have\nnever](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos826999) met anyone more racist than\nher. It was all F whites, F the police, F capitalism, all of that stuff. You\ncould not believe the look on her face when I revealed I had friends of all\nraces. I feared she was ready to fistfight me if I challenged any of her\nviews.’\n\nKrug was showing her date who she was, which game she was playing and by what\ncriteria she was claiming status. When we defend our sacred beliefs, like\nthis, we’re defending our experience of the world and our perceived value\nwithin it. But we don’t only defend our positions from attack. We go on the\noffensive. You might’ve had the experience of meeting someone new and having\nthem pepper their initial conversation with ambiguous remarks about\npoliticians, say, or controversial news events. When this happens, you’re\nusually being tested. The speaker is asking, what game is this person playing?\nAre they kin? Are we going be a source of status for one another?

In their use of these tender prods, they’re\nprowling the edge of your neural territory, on high alert for any clue that\nmight betray whether you’re playmate or enemy.\n\nThe extent of our warlike nature has been controversial. It’s been argued\nhumans have a biological switch that, when activated, means our games\nautomatically attack foes with violence. Most scholars now think this isn’t\ntrue. Some even argue life in the Stone Age lacked war pretty much entirely.\nThis seems incorrect for a number of reasons. [One of the\nfirst](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos827332) major cross-cultural\nstudies of intergroup conflict among hunter-gatherers found that, while some\ngroups were peaceful, 90 per cent fought wars more often than ‘rarely or\nnever’, with the majority fighting regularly. Most systematic studies support\nthe argument that warfare was common. Whilst intergroup violence might not be\nautomatic, it is an undeniable human tendency. In the modern era, it can be\nfound at all scales of society, from gang violence to religious sectarianism\nto state terrorism to civil and international war. The sad fact is, for all\nthe astonishing levels of nonviolence we extend towards our kin, when it comes\nto the aggression of game-versus-game we remain, [according to anthropologist\nProfessor](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos827737) Richard Wrangham,\n‘exceptionally’ violent.\n\nBut it’s only when we expand our conception of war to encompass battles over\nideological territory that we truly see what monstrously aggressive animals we\nare. People everywhere crusade on behalf of their sacred beliefs. When we go\non the attack, like this, we’re reaching into the minds of others and\nattempting to rearrange them such that they start playing our games, dreaming\nour dreams instead of theirs. Every convert’s theft is transmogrified into a\ngift: they go from stealing status from us to offering it. And it feels good.\nWe’re all so many neural imperialists, fighting to expand our territory by\nmaking incursions into the minds of others.\n\nOur thirst for these kinds of psychological conquests is evident in the\nhistory of white colonialists in Canada and Australia who prevented indigenous\npopulations from speaking their language and practising their religion. It’s\nevident in [the nearly four\nhundred](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos828053) re-education camps in\nwhich the Chinese have held hundreds of thousands of Uighur Muslims. It’s\nevident in the Communist regime of Enver Hoxha in which Albanians were\nimprisoned for wearing Western-style flared trousers or having an ‘imperialist\nhaircut’. It’s evident in the [more than two\nhundred](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos828323) thousand souls\nincarcerated by the East German Stasi, most of them psychologically tortured,\nsome physically brutalised and shot in prison basements, the most common\noffence being an alleged wish to leave Communist East for Capitalist West. [In\nthirteenth-century France](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos828579), when\nthe Cathars refused to convert, the Catholics who burned them alive were so\nafraid that their slightly different beliefs about God and Satan would somehow\nreanimate, and start conquering psychological territory, they dug up their\nbones and burned them again.\n\n[For political psychologist Dr](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos828869)\nLilliana Mason, part of the reason we continually attempt at warring for\nvictory is that ‘people are compelled to think of their groups as better than\nothers.",

Without that, they themselves feel inferior.’ At a ‘very primal level’\nplayers are motivated ‘to view the world through a competitive lens, with\nimportance placed on their own group’s superiority’. Humans love to become\nsuperior: to win. Researchers find groups tend to prefer the simple fact of\nwinning against other groups even if it means fewer benefits for its players.\n[Sociologist Professor Nicholas\nChristakis](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos829216) writes, this finding\n‘depresses me even more than the existence of xenophobia’. We want a lot for\nour groups, of course, but of even greater importance is creating a yawning\ndistance of victory between us and our rivals. ‘What seems to be important to\npeople is how much more members of one’s own group get compared to members of\nother groups, not how much one’s group has,’ he writes. ‘Not only must one’s\ngroup have a lot, it must have more than other groups.’\n\nThis goes, too, for wars of belief. We don’t just seek to win arguments with\nour ideological foes, we seek domination, as the citizens of The Well showed\nin their treatment of Mark Ethan Smith. They couldn’t ignore him because he\nwas stealing status from them; for the same reason, Smith couldn’t ignore\nthem. They couldn’t even bring themselves to use his preferred pronoun – an\nact that, symbolically, meant deference to his rules and symbols, thus defeat.\nSo he responded with threats and de-grading abuse; they responded with insult,\nostracization and censorship. They couldn’t simply live with one another’s\nclaims to status. One party had to win.\n\nThis is an inevitable, terrible consequence of the game of life we play.\nHaving status means being above. We continually seek to rearrange the world\nsuch that our game is on top, all the while telling self-serving stories about\nthe immaculate virtue of our behaviour. The lesson many will find impossible\nto accept is this: never believe groups who claim they just want ‘equality’\nwith rivals. No matter what they say, no matter what they believe, they don’t.\nThey weave a marvellous dream of fairness for all, but the dream is a lie.\n\n\n[19](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos5643)\n\n[The Tyranny of the Cousins](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos5643)\n\nSTATUS GAMES ARE potent organisms. They sometimes appear to be in possession\nof their own intelligence; to have a will that can overwhelm that of their\nplayers. The Satan-hunters became the puppets of their game, absorbing its\nwild dream then going out into the world to fight on its behalf. By their\ndutiful service, the game they belonged to grew in power. Similarly, when the\nGreat Mothers Questioning Vaccines turned on Maranda Dynda, and the men of The\nWell turned on Mark Ethan Smith, they did so in obedience to the organism. No\nsingle player had the ability to switch these mobbings on or off. It was as if\nthe game’s immune system fired up in the minds of its players. Under its\nstrange authority, the group moved as one in rejection of the foreign object.\n\nA game’s command over its players strengthens when it flips into a mode of\nwar. Connections between players tighten. These effects have been shown in\nnumerous studies. An [analysis of social\nties](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos829599) between World War II\nveterans found individuals who experienced combat with one another maintained\nstronger personal connections even forty years later.

Elsewhere,\n[Chinese participants having\ntheir](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos829929) brains scanned whilst\nreading about a threat from the Japanese showed ‘higher neural synchrony’ with\neach other. This tightening up – the thickening of the connections between\nthem – helped them coordinate faster in group tasks. Tighter games work better\ntogether: the dominion of the individual recedes, that of the group swells,\nand it becomes better able to defend itself from attack.\n\nBut this super-cohesive war mode is also triggered when there’s status to win.\nWe can see this in goldrush movements such as the Satanic Panic whose mad\nenergy seemed to derive principally from the prizes on offer. Studies confirm\ngroups can thicken up in this manner – offensively as well as defensively. In\none, cohesion and in-group preference were found to increase when one group\nwas awarded the prize of a transistor radio. The [‘opportunity to\nacquire](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos830220) resources’ was found to\nbe ‘a powerful context for triggering group cohesion’. It’s also consistent\nwith the different ways human groups have always made war. We defend ourselves\nfrom raids and we launch raids on others; both are highly co-operative\nendeavours that benefit from this super-cohesive mode of play.\n\nWhen a game thickens, individual players begin to merge with one another and\nits dream becomes more powerful. We become increasingly lost in it and devoted\nto serving it. But no single player is in control of this tightening up.\nEerily, it just happens. We begin coercing ourselves and each other. This\nhappens as a result of one of the most counter-intuitive facts about status\ngames and the premodern groups they grew out of: no one person is truly in\ncharge of them. In this era of presidents, queens, popes, celebrities,\nsuperstar activists and CEOs, it’s easy to assume leadership is a natural\nfeature of human life. But this is not the case. Although they were organised\naround hierarchies, hunter-gatherer communities weren’t very often ruled by a\nlone ‘big man’ figure. [Writes anthropologist Professor Christopher Boehm,\n‘sometimes a wise individual](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos830494) may\nbe accorded the status of temporary or permanent band leader. However, that\nperson is expected to behave with humility, for the accepted leadership style\npermits nothing more assertive than carefully listening to everyone else’s\nopinion and then gently helping to implement a consensus – if this\nspontaneously forms. Such decisions may involve a band’s next move or the\ngroup’s taking action against a serious deviant, but such leaders by\nthemselves cannot settle on an outcome; this is a decision for the entire\ngroup.’ And it would be that group, not the individual, that held final\nauthority.\n\nIt’s thought we evolved like this partly as a way of dealing with dominant\nplayers. For hundreds of thousands of years, when individuals (usually men)\nrepeatedly tried to force their way up the rankings with aggression and\nthreats of it, [we’ve killed](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos830805)\nthem. But executing unwanted players creates a new problem. We can’t play a\ngame whereby one player is able to simply denounce another for dominant\nbehaviour and take their life. Far from ridding us of the nuisance of dominant\nplay, this would incentivise it, as players could just accuse rivals of\nmalfeasance and take them out. So instead, the game itself made the decision.",

So instead, the game itself made the decision.\nPlayers would come together as an organism of thought and, only after\nconsensus was achieved, would a killing be permitted. In our tribal, kin-based\ngames it was our tribal kin who’d decide collectively whether unwanted players\nlived or died.\n\nFor the vast majority of our time on earth, then, humans haven’t been subject\nto the tyranny of leaders. Instead, we lived in fear of [what anthropologists\ncall the](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos831060) ‘tyranny of the\ncousins’. These ‘cousins’ weren’t necessarily actual cousins. They’d usually\nbe clan elders that, in these shallow hierarchies, passed for the elite.\nWhilst they’re thought to have almost always been men, both genders could take\npart in the act of deadly consensus-making. Writes Boehm, [‘when a\nband](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos831410) coalesces to bring down a\ntyrant, the females may be as active as the males in the political dynamics\ninvolved’. Some accounts even show men and women symbolically sharing\nresponsibility for an execution: in one, a man was beaten by [a band of\nmales](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos831677) who then fired poison\narrows into his body until he ‘looked like a porcupine’. When he was dead, the\nwomen stepped forward and stabbed his corpse with spears.\n\nThis might sound fair enough, if harsh. If a player attempts to dominate a\ngame through terror, that player is taken out. Execution is the ultimate\nhumiliation; a rejection by the game that’s physical as well as psychological,\nnot to mention final. But unfortunately for the history of the human race,\nit’s not quite as straightforward as this. The problem is, there aren’t two\nseparate and easily identifiable forms of player – tyrants and non-tyrants. We\nall contain the capacity for tyranny. Who’s the tyrant and who’s the victim\ncan often be difficult to tell. The cousins themselves could be brutal.\n\nIndeed, the same hunter-gatherer groups that came together to bloodily cancel\ntyrants also used deadly force against those who broke many other of their\ngame’s rules. [Players could be\nexecuted](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos831955) for theft and hoarding\nof meat, for malicious sorcery, for unauthorised viewing of the magic trumpets\nand for ‘treading on the men’s secret path’. The games we evolved to play\ncould be oppressive and terrifying. Anthropologist Professor Richard Wrangham\ndescribes us as having lived in a [‘social cage\nof](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos832380) tradition’ in which players\n‘lived or died by their willingness to conform’. The power of these cousins\nwas ‘absolute. If you did not conform to their dictates, you were in danger.’\n\nWe’ve encountered these dynamics in Mehrana, India. When the high-caste girl\nwas caught with an untouchable boy, the village elders held an all-night\nmeeting, proposed their being hanged from a banyan tree and encountered no\nprotests from three thousand villagers. Wrangham describes a similar account\nof [deadly consensus-making\namongst](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos832644) the Gebusi people in New\nGuinea. A member of the tribe had become seriously ill and malicious sorcery\nwas blamed.

A member of the tribe had become seriously ill and malicious sorcery\nwas blamed. At a meeting, a medium conducted a ritual with magic leaves that\nindicated a relative of the patient was the culprit. Now under threat, the\naccused had to strategise. He couldn’t risk appearing unrepentant by outright\ndenial. Instead, he flirted desperately with confession: ‘I don’t know\nanything about it. He’s my own relative, too, I couldn’t make him sick. I\ndon’t know … I might have been a little angry from not eating enough fish\nlately, but I certainly wouldn’t make my own relative sick like that.’ In the\ndays following the meeting, the man’s accuser went about the community quietly\nbuilding support for deadly action. During a night-time meeting, the cousins\ngrew ‘more and more enthusiastic about the idea that the alleged sorcerer was\nresponsible for the death’, writes Wrangham. ‘Consensus is reached. All decide\nthe accused is guilty. At dawn, they stage an ambush. They kill with clubs or\narrows. Sometimes there is torture first. Then they butcher and cook him.’\n\nThe impression of consensus, in our groups, was vital. It didn’t have to be a\ntechnical consensus. What counted was the general sense of the group, as an\norganism, supporting the action. It was often built in a boiling atmosphere of\ngossip and the recounting of past sins that would generate plumes of moral\noutrage, directed at the accused. As well as executions, [the group could\nexact](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos832920) punishments of shame: these\ncould begin as simple ‘social aloofness’ as targets weren’t greeted. They\ncould also be ignored, mocked and humiliated. When a [member of the\nMbuti](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos833167) in the Congo was caught\ncheating during a hunt, men and women began gossiping about him, insulting him\nbehind his back, detailing past misdemeanours. His reputation was monstered as\nconsensus on the corruption of his character grew. On his return to camp he\nwas ignored: nobody, not even the children, offered him a seat as was proper.\nWhen he tried taking one by force he was told, ‘animals lie on the ground’.\nWhen he was accused of cheating publicly, he first tried lying then wept in\napology, clutching his stomach saying he would die because he wasn’t\nrespected.\n\nThe cousins were terrible and powerful and we still carry a deep dread of them\nwithin us. They make their presence known in the enormous literature that\nshows how naturally we can conform to the perceptions of our groups: [an\niconic 1951 experiment](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos833436) by\npsychologist Professor Solomon Asch had participants making simple and obvious\nassessments as to which of three lines was the nearest in length to another.\nWhen seven fake participants voiced a different majority view, 32 per cent of\npeople conformed to their judgement. No overt pressure was applied to these\nparticipants. That nearly a third of them were prepared to deny the clear\nevidence of their eyes when the power of the group was so weak, and the stakes\nso low, hints at the extent to which humans are likely to conform to the\ndreams of a group when it’s 1938, say, and you’re living in Moscow or Berlin.\nWe fear the cousins; we’re compelled to play obediently by their social cage\nof rules.\n\nBut the cousins are also inside us.

[A study into\nthe](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos834397) reasons schoolchildren, aged\nbetween 5 and 7, reject playmates found a tendency to do so when their\nbehaviour became a threat to the status of themselves or their clique.\nPsychologist Professor Francisco Juan García Bacete has said, [‘what actually\nleads](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos834862) to rejection are the\nrejecters’ interpretations of the child’s behaviour, and whether they think it\nwill have a negative impact on themselves or their social group’. Elsewhere,\nbrain scans show the mere anticipation of a transgressor being punished for\nrule-breaks is experienced as pleasurable.\n\nWe don’t like to think of ourselves this way. The story we prefer removes\noppression and hatred from our essential game-playing human nature and blames\nit on corrupted leaders and their evil schemes. We can see this mode of\nnaivety in the pioneers of internet and social media who predicted that\nconnecting millions of humans together online would create a kind of utopia.\nIn 1996, a former member of The Well, [John Perry Barlow,\npublished](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos835155) a ‘Declaration of the\nIndependence of Cyberspace’ in which he announced a new ‘civilisation of the\nMind’ was being created in which the old hierarchies of power were not\nwelcome. ‘I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally\nindependent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us … We are creating a\nworld where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how\nsingular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity.’\n\nThat’s not how it turned out. Today, even seemingly innocuous comments on\nsocial media can lead to a group coalescing in screeching outrage. Online mobs\nplay virtue-dominance games: status is awarded to players who enforce their\nrules to those both inside and outside their groups. They’re also tight: the\nplayers involved are highly conformist. These mobs throb with the horrible\npower of the cousins. Their attacks are often deleted or Swiss-cheesed after\nthey’ve occurred. But occasionally some survive. [One such case\nis](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos835455) that of Karen Templer, the\nmobbing of whom ranged across multiple platforms, including YouTube and\nInstagram, but also in comments beneath her blog which she declined to erase,\n‘as I don’t believe in editing the historical record’.\n\nTempler is a knitter and owner of the knitting website Fringe Association\n(tagline: Knit and Let Knit). In January 2019 she uploaded a blog called ‘My\nYear of Color’ in which, amongst other things, she looked forward to a trip to\nIndia. Templer had once found the prospect of foreign travel ‘daunting’ but\nnow wanted to ‘be a person who says yes more’. India’s literature and history\nhad been a ‘lifelong obsession’. The family of a childhood friend, who was\nIndian, once offered to take her: ‘To a suburban midwestern teenager with a\nsevere anxiety disorder, that was like being offered a seat on a flight to\nMars. It was fun to think about, but are you kidding me?’ When a new\nopportunity came along, she found the courage to say yes. ‘I felt like the top\nof my head was going to fly off, I was so indescribably excited.’\n\nAt first, the comments were supportive. ‘Right on!’ wrote Christine Lindop.",

Yes!!\n\nCheryl Ortwein: YAHOOOO\n\nMiss Agnes: You go girl!\n\nDeepa: The US is now my home in every sense (20 years!) and my heart is here,\nbut my soul will always be in India. I tell people it is like no other place\non earth, truly. It is everything you have heard about it and yet it will\nsurprise you in every way.\n\nDiane: Best. Post.

India will always be special to me because I grew up\nthere.\n\nMarie Carter: You are even more inspiring than I thought\n![](../Images/00001.jpg)\n\nDuni: Congratufuckinglations!\n\nBut then there arrived an ominous post: ‘I came across an interesting review\nof the article on instagram and despite being priviledged [sic] and [a white?]\nperson myself, I agree with the critics – we have to be careful about how we\ncommunicate colour. Language is so powerful and some of the statements are\nquestionable and very inconsiderate.’\n\nTempler was worried. ‘I have[n’t] seen whatever criticism you’re referring to\nor agreeing with,’ she wrote. ‘What is it that you find inconsiderate in what\nI’ve said here?’\n\n‘Karen,’ wrote Alex J Klein, ‘I’d ask you to re-read what you wrote and think\nabout how your words feed into a colonial/imperialist mindset toward India and\nother non-Western countries. Multiple times you compare the idea of going to\nIndia to the idea of going to another planet – how do you think a person from\nIndia would feel to hear that?’\n\nOf course, at least three people ostensibly from India responded to Templer’s\npost with statements of joyful encouragement. ‘What I said is that, as a\nteenager, India felt as far away and unattainable to me as Mars,’ Templer\nwrote, ‘that it was impossible to contemplate actually being able to go to\neither place. I’m not sure how that’s imperialist but will give it some\nthought.’ She noted the positive feedback from Indian friends and readers.\n‘I’ll have to see if anything I said offended them.’\n\n‘Instead of asking your Indian friends to perform more emotional labor for you\nand assuage your white women’s tears,’ Klein replied, ‘maybe do some\nreflection on how your equation of India with an alien world reinforces an\n“other” mindset that is at the core of imperialism and colonialism.’\n\nOther attackers soon flapped in and landed, including Caroline who thanked\nKlein for his intervention – ‘I second your comment whole-heartedly’ – and\nSarah, who added, ‘Romanticizing other lands and cultures is a dangerous thing\nto do.’ Templer apologised. She attempted once more to explain herself: ‘The\nonly way in which I was equating India and Mars, as I just said to Alex above,\nis that they would have seemed equally far away and out of reach to my teenage\nself.’\n\n‘Rather than being defensive,’ wrote Caroline, ‘I ask you to truly listen to\nwhat people have said to you here and on instagram.

While you’re\nat it, you should read about white fragility and intent vs. impact. Regardless\nof what you intended by this post, the impact has been completely different\nfor many people. You need to go educate yourself.’\n\n‘To everyone I offended by what I’ve written here, I want to say I hear you\nand I am sorry,’ wrote Templer.\n\n‘You’re sorry people are offended?’ wrote Rachel. ‘That’s not an apology for\nyour deeply racist and reductive statement. Please rethink this trip. Don’t\nforce the people of India to deal with you and your colonializing mindset.’\n\nSome of Templer’s readers voiced support, but others began turning against\nher. Marie Carter, who’d previously written, ‘You are even more inspiring than\nI thought ![](../Images/00001.jpg)’, now wrote: ‘I am ashamed to say that I\nfailed to consider the impact of this post on all of us non-white people … my\nheart hurts and I won’t be able to live with myself unless I acknowledge the\npain to me and others like me of the words used. I am no longer going to say\nnothing.’\n\n‘Same here,’ replied Liz N who described reading ‘thousands of comments’ about\nher post on Instagram.\n\nTempler relented. In [a follow-up\nblog](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos835785) entitled ‘Words Matter’ she\nconfessed to being ‘insensitive’ and ‘horrible’ and ‘careless’ for treating\nIndia like a ‘backdrop for white people’ and perpetuating ‘the harmful notion\nthat Indians (and POC in general) are “other,” or even to be feared’. She\nended by apologising yet again, ‘profusely to everyone I hurt, and to everyone\nwho has taken any kind of heat for calling me out on it. I was wrong, and the\nwomen who took the risk to speak out were right.’\n\nIt’s haunting to witness the parallels between what anthropologists find in\npremodern societies and what we see, here, in the twenty-first-century tribal\nbattlegrounds of social media. Templer’s initial response to her accusers\nrecalls the account from the Gebusi, in which the accused worriedly flits\nbetween defence and confession: ‘He’s my own relative, too, I couldn’t make\nhim sick. I don’t know … I might have been a little angry from not eating\nenough fish lately.’ It’s in the sense, if not the reality, of a ferociously\ngrowing consensus against the deviant. It’s in the gossip, the social\ndistancing, the shaming. It’s in the extremely local weirdness of the\naccusations. For players living inside the accusers’ dream, it was apparently\nobvious how their target had transgressed the rules. But to those outside it,\nher crime was obscure: Templer had viewed the magic trumpets. For her sin the\ncousins had coalesced for attack and were building consensus against her, in\nall their righteousness and thirst.\n\nIn the end, she saved herself. At the time of writing, Templer’s company still\nexists, as does her blog.

The effects\nof a cancellation can be as mild as the loss of limited amounts of work or as\nsevere as the destruction of livelihood and reputation – or worse. Examples\nare numerous and easy to find. In recent years, academics have been denounced\nand had papers retracted and honorifics removed; public intellectuals have\nbeen ‘de-platformed’ from events; journalists, editors, agents and business\nleaders have been fired or forced to resign; athletes and authors have lost\ncontracts; businesses including [a food\ntruck](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos836103) and [a yoga\nstudio](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos836405) have shut down; [British\njournalist Helen Lewis](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos836650) had her\ncomputer game voiceover removed in a software update; drag queen [Vanity von\nGlow was](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos836998) banned from performing\nat various London venues; [Tabitha Moore-Morris,\na](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos837261) Kentucky hospital worker, lost\nher job of twenty years; [brilliant Silicon Valley\ntechnologist](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos837576), Austen Heinz, lost\nhis reputation and committed suicide.\n\nThese mobs don’t seek to win over their victims and turn them into allies.\nThey seek the maximal removal of their status and any of its symbols; ideally,\nreputational death. In a world dominated by games of prestige, this is how we\ndo killing. The ultimate target of cancellation is not the human, but their\nbelief. Mobs are performative. They say to their many onlookers, ‘if you\nexpress this opinion, you too can expect a call from the cousins’. No single\nperson is in charge of these mobs just as no single person can stop them. They\njust happen, usually when someone expresses a view that contradicts a game’s\nsacred symbolic beliefs. The tyrannical group can accept no challenge to their\ncriteria for claiming status. When their mob grows into a status goldrush, a\nmassive blast of vindictive energy gets directed at the victim. Attracted by\nthe prizes, more and more ambitious players pile in and the game becomes an\nanimal of attack, glorying in the ecstasy of dominance.\n\nTo understand how this form of status play is affecting society, we can travel\nto northern Iraq. It’s the summer of 2014 and a group of selfie-taking\n[activists, predominantly\nmillennials](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos837843), are on their way to\nthe city of Mosul. They are ISIS and they’re playing a dominance-virtue game.\nTheir social media uploads show them black-clad and heavily armed and include\nvideos of the nightmarish torture and execution they’d inflict on captured\nenemies – all under the hashtag #AllEyesOnISIS. This became the top-trending\nhashtag on Arabic Twitter. ISIS had nearly fifty digital hubs in different\nregions, each targeting content to different demographics.

Their hashtag ‘took on the power of an invisible\nartillery bombardment, its thousands of messages spiralling out in front of\nthe advancing force. Their detonation would sow terror, disunion and\ndefection.’ As they approached Mosul, thousands of Iraqi soldiers fled, many\nleaving weapons and vehicles behind. By the time they arrived at the\noutskirts, ‘only a handful of brave (or confused) soldiers and police remained\nbehind. It wasn’t a battle but a massacre, dutifully filmed and edited for the\nnext cycle of easy online distribution.’ ISIS used ‘a different sort of\nblitzkrieg, one that used the internet itself as a weapon’ and it was by this\nmethod their ‘improbable momentum’ continued.\n\nOnline mobs are like ISIS. They use social media in the same way as the\nterrorist group. Western cultures have a sacred rule forbidding bigotry.\nLeaders of corporations and the institutions of government, media and\neducation know that to be suspected of misogyny, racism, homophobia or\ntransphobia is to face reputational death. This is what these mobs threaten.\nIt’s not necessary for elites to be directly accused of these transgressions,\nit’s enough to witness the mob’s performance. By this method, just like ISIS,\nactivists use the dread machine of social media to gain a level of status –\nand the influence and power that goes with it – that massively outsizes their\nnumbers.\n\nWe can know this through public surveys. The year after Templer’s mobbing,\n[one of the largest](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos838146) ever studies\nof Britain’s social psychology was published, containing data from over ten\nthousand respondents. It found seven distinct opinion groups, describing\n‘progressive activists’ as being the one ‘motivated by the pursuit of social\njustice’. They make for a ‘powerful and vocal group for whom politics is at\nthe core of their identity’. The progressive activists believe the game is\nessentially fixed, that a player’s life outcomes are ‘determined more by the\nsocial structures in which they grow up than by their individual efforts’. Of\nall the groups, they’re the most highly educated and also the wealthiest, with\nmore earning a household income above £50,000 than any other. They’re also\n‘the dominant voice’ on social media, a realm in which they play a ‘commanding\nrole’. They’re six times more likely to post about politics on Twitter and\nother platforms than any other group. They make more total social media\ncontributions than the rest of the nation combined. And yet, as of 2020, they\ncomprised just 13 per cent of the population. [In the USA, a similar\nstudy](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos838590) found they numbered 8 per\ncent.\n\nNational surveys reveal how marginal their beliefs and behaviours are. General\nattitudes in the UK and US seem relatively progressive: [in 1958, just\n4](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos838840) per cent of Americans favoured\ninterracial marriage compared to 87 per cent in 2013. Only [3 per cent\nof](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos839087) Britons believe being ‘truly\nBritish’ requires being white; [73 per cent\nagree](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos839427) hate speech is an issue;\nmore than half think [transphobia is\n‘somewhat](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos839670)’ or ‘a great deal’ of a\nproblem. And yet many behaviours that characterise progressive activists and\ntheir mobs are unpopular. The politically correct policing of speech is\nlargely unwelcome in both nations.",

Only [3 per cent\nof](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos839087) Britons believe being ‘truly\nBritish’ requires being white; [73 per cent\nagree](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos839427) hate speech is an issue;\nmore than half think [transphobia is\n‘somewhat](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos839670)’ or ‘a great deal’ of a\nproblem. And yet many behaviours that characterise progressive activists and\ntheir mobs are unpopular. The politically correct policing of speech is\nlargely unwelcome in both nations. Across all US racial groups, [80 per cent\nbelieve](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos840044) ‘political correctness is\na problem in this country’; 87 per cent of Hispanics and three-quarters of\nAfrican Americans agree. In the UK, [72 per cent\nbelieve](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos840353) political correctness has\nbecome a problem. [A sizeable minority,\n29](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos840617) per cent, agree that Britain\nis a ‘systematically or institutionally racist country’. [Polling company\nYouGov found much](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos841024) lower support\nfor other positions associated with progressive activism: 12 per cent believed\nit was fair to punish an adult for controversial views they expressed online\nas a teenager; 10 per cent thought it ‘not okay’ for non-Japanese people to\nwear a kimono and only 5 per cent thought the next Governor of the Bank of\nEngland should be a woman (3 per cent thought it should be a man; 87 per cent\nsaid gender didn’t matter).\n\nOf course, progressive activists don’t only gain outsized status via their\nmobs. With their peerless levels of wealth and education, they’re also able to\ninsert their elites into many of society’s most powerful games. It’s important\nto note, too, that concluding all progressive activists approve of mob\nbehaviour would be extremely unfair. But this is the point. Those who play in\ntheir mobs are a minority of a minority. And yet too often their commanding\nvoice on social media becomes a commanding voice in our democracies. Like\nISIS, they achieve this outsized status partly by the spreading of dread.\nTheir gossip, accusation and merciless fury is designed to weave the illusion\nof consensus, wake our ancient dread of the cousins and bully us into their\nsocial cage.\n\nThis is how mobs win.\n\n\n[20](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos5746)\n\n[Victims, Warriors, Witches ](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos5746)\n\nWHEN A GAME goes to war, it tightens up. It strengthens its dominion over\nindividual players, whose selves increasingly merge in its service. Its dreams\nturn wilder and darker. Its heroes seem more heroic, its villains more\nvillainous, its moral lessons become purer. Players who tell tales that\nreaffirm its self-serving narrative are rewarded with status. Their accounts\nare often those of victimhood that draw their foes as powerful, heartless and\ndangerous. When actual reality provides a paucity of such accounts, players\ncan simply invent them.

Following an investigation, police concluded the\npost had been written by Meg Lanker-Simons.\n\nThis wasn’t an isolated incident. Notorious hoaxes in recent years include\nthat of US [actor Jussie Smollett](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos842257)\nwho police accused of faking a racist, homophobic assault by Trump supporters\nbecause he ‘wanted to promote his career’; [a campaign of\noffensive](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos842540) graffiti at Vassar\nCollege reportedly including ‘Hey Tranny. Know Your Place’ that was found to\nbe the work of two students, one of whom, Genesis Hernandez, was a transgender\nactivist and member of the college’s Bias Incident Response Team; psychologist\nProfessor [Kerri Dunn, described\nby](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos843187) the Los Angeles Times as ‘a\nhero to many students … [for] lifting her voice for the oppressed’, who, after\n[delivering a lecture on](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos843864) hate\nspeech, found her car smashed, slashed and graffitied with [‘Kike\nWhore’](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos844172), ‘NiggerLover’, ‘Bitch’,\n‘Shut Up’ and a half-finished swastika, and who, it was subsequently\ndiscovered, committed the vandalism herself. This mode of performative story-\nmaking isn’t only carried out by players on the left. In 2008 [Republican\ncampaign volunteer Ashley](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos844500) Todd\nfaked an attack in which she said an African American knocked her to the\nground and scratched ‘B’ for Barack Obama into her face. Similarly, [in 2007,\nPrinceton student](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos844816) Francisco Nava\nfalsely claimed to have been threatened then beaten unconscious due to his\nmembership of the conservative Anscombe Society.\n\nThese hoaxers reaffirmed the simplistic moral stories their games told of the\nworld, reassuring them their criteria for claiming status were true. They\nappeared on television, in newspapers, in lecture halls and at the head of\ncampus demonstrations. In times of war we honour our victims. Their tales are\nof suffering and of bravery and survival: out of their victimhood they become\nheroic. They allow their co-players to feel heroic, too, in their coming\ntogether in noble defiance of the monsters.\n\nOut of this coalition will often emerge a few who possess the courage and\nambition to step up and make active war with the enemy. These warriors are\nusually thirstier for rank than other players. [An analysis of\nwarriorship](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos845112) in premodern\nsocieties discovered a positive relationship between conflict intensity and\nthe status on offer for fighters. ‘Warriors are motivated to participate in\nwarfare because of the possibility of rewards,’ it found.

Collective narcissism was found to be a ‘specific and unique,\nsystematic predictor of hypersensitivity to in-group insult and proclivity for\nhostile over-reaction’.\n\n[Warriors are also likely](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos845963) to\nstrongly identify with their game, believing in it utterly and having more of\ntheir personal status invested in it. ‘When a group’s status is threatened, a\nstrongly identified group member will fight to maintain the status of the\ngroup,’ writes political psychologist Dr Lilliana Mason. It’s their\nidentification with the game that ‘drives the group member to take action to\nmaintain positive group status’. [In one study,\nparticipants](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos846290) watched the film\nRocky IV, with some seeing a re-edited version in which the American hero\nloses to the Russian fighter, Ivan Drago. Viewers who most closely identified\nwith being American suffered ‘severe hits’ to their sense of status, feeling\n‘very negatively about themselves after watching Rocky lose’. The\npsychologists then gave them the chance to voice hostile opinions about their\nrivals, the Russians. Those who did, making ‘insulting judgements’ about them,\nfelt their injured pride recover.\n\nWarriors – highly identified with their game and often narcissistic on its\nbehalf – can become drunk on the status earned from warring, and seek to make\nbattle almost anywhere. They fight defensively and also offensively, picking\nopportunistic fights with foes. This kind of virtue-dominance play is\nconspicuous on social media where warriors play a game of attack, defend and\nwin, earning status for themselves and their group. Their strategies are\nrevealed in [analyses of tweets\nthat](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos846605) find those most likely to be\nretweeted contain more moral words, more emotion, and more moral outrage. [A\nstudy of seventy](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos847009) million messages\non the Chinese platform Weibo found the emotion that ‘travelled fastest and\nfarthest through the social network’ was anger. Meanwhile, [studies of mobbing\nevents](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos847271) on Twitter find shamers\nincrease their follower counts faster than non-shamers.\n\nHistorically, the role of the ‘cousins’ was to enforce a game’s norms, whilst\nwarriors went out into the world to fight on its behalf, grabbing resources\nfrom rival groups or defending them from raiders. But in the modern world\nthese archetypes often merge. Theoretically, the Great Mothers Questioning\nVaccines had cousins within their Facebook group, where they enforced their\nbeliefs, and warriors outside it, where they’d defend and evangelise their\ncriteria for claiming status. But in reality they were often the same person.\nParticipants in online mobs are warriors doing the bidding of their own\ninternal cousins. We all have the capacity to engage in these suites of\nbehaviour: it’s in our coding and has been for hundreds of thousands of years.\nA warning someone’s slipped into this state of tightness is their seeming\nwholly obsessed with their game’s sacred beliefs and their enforcement. They\ncan seem able to think and talk of little else. They find this pleasurable\nbecause they’re playing a symbolic game of status with them: with every\nthought, utterance and expression of active belief, they earn prizes.\n\nThe British television star Jameela Jamil has arguably achieved greater status\nfor her online warring than for presenting or acting.",

Focussing on issues\naround mental health and body image, she’s argued that those who don’t admit\nto having their photos retouched [are guilty of\na](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos847729) ‘disgusting crime’. She’s\npublicly attacked elite women such as [the Kardashians, Cardi\nB](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos848031),\n[Rihanna](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos848321), [Miley Cyrus, Nicki\nMinaj](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos848545), Iggy Azelea, [Caroline\nCalloway](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos848848),\n[Beyoncé](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos849184) and [J. K.\nRowling](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos849491). In 2019 she criticised a\nTV show centred on plastic surgery, [presented by Caroline\nFlack](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos849775), with whom she engaged in a\nhostile Twitter exchange. Flack was then subjected to an ‘online pile-on’ by\nJamil’s followers, with one asking how she could defend ‘a show this toxic and\nexploitative that you’re willingly hosting?’ Four months later, when Flack\ncommitted suicide following highly publicised issues in her private life,\nJamil wrote: ‘It was only a matter of time before the media and the prolonged\nsocial media dogpile, hers lasted for MONTHS, pushed someone completely over\nthe edge.’ [A journalist then\nreleased](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos850188) a private message he’d\nbeen sent by Flack: ‘I’m struggling with Jameela. The hate she aims at me.’\nFor her warring, Jamil has won significant status. In 2019, she was selected\nby Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, to appear on the cover of Vogue magazine as\none of fifteen female ‘Forces for Change’. She has more than a million\nfollowers on Twitter and, on Instagram, over three million.\n\nNaturally there are warriors on the opposing side too. In January 2020,\nanother British actor, Laurence Fox, made headlines following an appearance on\nthe BBC debate show Question Time in which he rebutted the charge of being a\n‘white privileged male’ as ‘racist’. [He later complained\nthe](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos850458) inclusion of Sikh soldiers in\nthe First World War film 1917 was an act of ‘forced diversity’ before\napologising on learning 130,000 Sikhs fought in the war. He then attempted to\nfoment a [boycott of the\nsupermarket](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos850825) chain Sainsbury’s for\ntheir support of Black History Month, which he claimed amounted to ‘racial\nsegregation and discrimination’. [Before his Question Time\nappearance](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos851235), Fox had just under\nfifty thousand Twitter followers. By the end of the year, he’d surpassed a\nquarter of a million.\n\nWarriors such as Jamil and Fox earn significant status in spite of their\nerrors, reversals and shamings.

One\ninvestigation found [those most likely\nto](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos851502) circulate ‘hostile political\nrumours’ including conspiracy theories and ‘fake news’ on social media were\noften ‘status-obsessed, yet socially marginalised’, their behaviour fuelled by\na ‘thwarted desire for high status’, their aim, to ‘mobilise the audience\nagainst disliked elites’.\n\nUnder these conditions, the dream we weave over reality can become brutish and\nhysterical. As we saw in the mobbing of Karen Templer, a game’s moral\npositions can shift, morphing into more and more extreme versions of\nthemselves. Templer was targeted after writing her invitation to India felt\nlike being ‘offered a seat on a flight to Mars’. In the pathologically tight\nfantasy world of her accusers, this statement was proof she was a racist, a\ncolonialist, a white supremacist. Researchers [Dr Justin Tosi\nand](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos851814) Dr Brandon Warmke describe\nthe process of ‘ramping up’ by which status-strivers, trying to outdo one\nanother, push their game’s moral positions into ever tighter places: ‘Once we\nhear what others’ views are (or at least what they say they are), we have two\noptions. We can either accept that we are morally ordinary and keep our views\nas they are, or we can ever so slightly shift our views (or at least our\npresentation of them) to retain our status as the moral exemplar within the\ngroup. For many, the latter option is preferable.’ When warriors ramp up, in\nthis way, they’re ‘not trying to arrive at the correct moral claim … What\ndrives them is the desire to be the most morally impressive.’\n\nAs the game becomes tighter its dream becomes stranger: purer, stricter and\nmade out of more extreme beliefs. Then what do we do, us ordinary players?\nRisk the wrath of the cousins and their caste of warriors by voicing our\ndoubts? Or keep our heads down and play along? We’ve already encountered the\nfamous Solomon Asch ‘lines study’ of conformity, in which a third of\nparticipants in a comparatively loose laboratory group denied the clear\nevidence of their eyes, announcing their beliefs matched those of the\nmajority. [A study led by](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos852092)\npsychologist Professor Robb Willer found similar dynamics. Participants tasted\nsamples of wine and were asked to choose their favourite by rating them on a\nscale. They weren’t told these samples were actually identical, from the same\nbottle. They were to be the fifth out of six reviewers. When they saw the\nfirst four tasters had assessed one sample as greatly superior, just over half\nthe participants agreed with them – a result showing conformity at even\ngreater rates than Asch. And then, the twist. A sixth reviewer came in and\ntold the truth, saying they tasted identical. The participants were then asked\nto rate the tasters. Who had better palates? The lying first four? Or the\ntruth-telling sixth? When asked privately, they rated the sixth. But those\nasked publicly not only endorsed the false majority view, they punished the\nsole teller of truth by downgrading them.\n\nFor the researchers, these behaviours are a predictable consequence of a\ngame’s becoming dangerously tight. Some players will be true believers, swept\nup into the dream entirely. Others won’t. They’ll sense its gathering madness.",

Some players will be true believers, swept\nup into the dream entirely. Others won’t. They’ll sense its gathering madness.\nBut, nervous of the power of the cousins, they’ll pretend to believe. These\nfalse believers still act as if they’re loyal players, adhering to the game’s\nrules, symbols and beliefs. But in the secret psychological territory in their\nskulls, they’ve lost faith in the dreamed-up story. Because tight groups tend\ntowards irrationality and aggressive conformity, they’re frequently populated\nby both true and false believers. The false believers often attempt to prove\ntheir loyalty with active belief, enforcing the rules. They do this ‘to\ndemonstrate their sincerity’, write the researchers. ‘That is, to show that\nthey did not conform simply to secure social approval. This is because, to\ntrue believers in the group, mere conformity is insufficient. Those who\nconform may only be posturing for group approval.’\n\nSo who are the true believers? And who are the dangerous hidden deviants\nbetraying our dream of reality from within? The game becomes even tighter as\nplayers ‘pressure one another in order to cover up their own private doubts’.\nThis makes suspicions increase yet further. The game can then enter what\nsociologists Dr Bradley Campbell and Dr Jason Manning [call a\n‘purity](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos852446) spiral’ in which players\n‘strive to outdo one another in displays of zealotry, condemning and expelling\nmembers of their own movement for smaller and smaller deviations from its core\nvirtues’. They jostle to prove themselves honest by accusing and denouncing\nothers, each desperate to demonstrate their acceptance of the game. Any\ndeviants discovered can be shamed, ostracized or even killed. When a game\nenters this mode of play, it’s started hunting witches.\n\n[The European witch-hunts](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos852796), which\nwere most active between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries, usually took\nplace in times of severe pressure for the group, when hostile climactic\nconditions led to crop failures and food shortages. These pressures, writes\nhistorian Professor Peter Marshall, contributed to [‘a heightened\nsense](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos854379) of the need for societal\npurity and uniformity, which manifested itself in action against these most\nabnormal of deviants’. A diabolical dream was woven around these\nmeteorological events that said they were caused by false believers living\namong them who had supernatural powers. But witchcraft wasn’t easy to prove.\nWhen a game descends into this state, it’s typical for enforcers to argue\nthey’re dealing with an exceptional problem which requires an exceptional\nrelaxation of legal protections. For witch-hunter [Henri Boguet,\n‘Witchcraft](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos854679) is a crime apart …\nTherefore the trial of this crime must be conducted in an extraordinary\nmanner; and the usual legalities and ordinary procedures cannot be strictly\nobserved.’ For Jean Bodin, ‘proof of such evil is so obscure and difficult\nthat not one of a million witches would be accused and punished if regular\nlegal procedure were followed’. During the century and a half of the most\nintense witch hunting, [at least eighty\nthousand](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos855198) people were tried,\naround half of whom were executed. [Most were poor\nwomen](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos855522), often widows. In one\nGerman town, around four hundred were killed in a single day.",

In one\nGerman town, around four hundred were killed in a single day.\n\nSimilar dynamics occurred during the years of the Spanish Inquisition. [In\n1478, Spain’](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos856008)s monarchs approved\nthe introduction of a special court to find out what was happening in the\npsychological territory of former Jews that, following a period of pressure,\nhad converted to Christianity. The Tribunal of the Holy Office of the\nInquisition would investigate claims of secret Jewish belief and practice in\nthese ‘conversos’. They had legal protections for their quarry removed: [under\ncanon law, anonymous](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos856292)\ndenunciations had been forbidden, now they were not only permitted but\nencouraged. ‘The records of the Inquisition are full of instances where\nneighbours denounced neighbours, friends denounced friends, and members of the\nsame family denounced each other,’ writes historian Professor Henry Kamen. The\nmotivation for some was sheer greed: accused conversos were often removed from\ntheir jobs and had property confiscated. ‘Very many of those arrested and\nburnt by the reverend fathers were arrested and burnt only because of their\nproperty,’ wrote one converso. According to another, in the Castile region,\n‘fifteen hundred people have been burnt through false witness’. And yet the\ninquisitors declared ‘false witness’ at their procedures to be extremely rare.\nOfficial records of one set of 1,172 trials found just eight cases of perjury.\nJust like the witch-hunters elsewhere in Europe, the Satan-hunters of America\nin the 1980s and the online mobbers of the social media age, they played a\ngame that awarded prizes on the discovery of deviants – and they discovered\ndeviants everywhere.\n\nAs the inquisition’s dominance-virtue play was rewarded, their game gained\npower, their dream of reality darkened and their perception of their enemies\nbecame sociopathically vindictive. Conversos were prosecuted for the mildest\nof perceived slights against the Catholic game. One woman was reported for\nsmiling when someone mentioned the Virgin Mary; another for not eating pork\nand changing her linen on a Saturday (she was tortured on the rack); a man in\nhis eighties was brought before the inquisition for eating bacon on a Friday,\ntraditionally a meat-free day. Simple ignorance, such as not knowing the\ncreed, was accepted as evidence of heretical belief. The atmosphere for those\nunder suspicion could be suffocating. Terrified conversos began denouncing\nthemselves.

Psychologist Professor Michele Gelfand studies\nthese effects globally. [She finds nations\nthat](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos856798) have suffered events such as\ndisease, famine, natural disaster or conflict have tighter cultures with\nstronger social norms and less tolerance for deviance than looser nations.\n[‘Groups that deal](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos857096) with many\necological and historical threats need to do everything they can to create\norder in the face of chaos,’ she writes. [‘The greater\nthe](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos857401) threat, the tighter the\ncommunity.’\n\n[In tight cultures –](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos857696) that include\nPakistan, Germany, Malaysia, Switzerland, India, Singapore, Norway, Turkey,\nJapan and China – players dress more similarly, buy more similar things and\npossess superior self-control: they tend to have lower rates of crime, alcohol\nabuse and obesity. [Their citizens are\nmore](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos857978) punctual, and so is their\npublic transport: Swiss trains have an average 97 per cent punctuality rate;\nin 2014, fourteen trains in Singapore arrived more than 30 minutes late; in\n2013, Japan’s Shinkansens had an average delay of 54 seconds. [Even the time\nshown](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos858249) on public clocks across\ntight nations is more likely to be in sync.\n\nPeople raised in tight cultures are also [greater respecters of\nhierarchy](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos858524) and authority. Tight\nplayers are more likely to earn status from [precisely correct moral\nbehaviour](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos859283), to a sometimes comical\nextent. In Germany, where rules mandate certain hours of the week as ‘quiet’,\n[one resident complained about](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos859556) a\nbarking dog: in court the judge permitted the animal to bark for thirty\nminutes per day in ten-minute intervals.

It’s obviously not true that every\nindividual in Singapore and Switzerland is more conformist than every citizen\nof Britain and Brazil. It’s also a fact that tightness-looseness isn’t a\nbinary setting: it exists on a spectrum. But we all have a sense of what it\nlooks like when a game becomes uncomfortably tight. Its players blend into one\nanother as the social cage descends and their dreams of reality more perfectly\ncombine. They become ‘single-minded’, increasingly obsessed with their game\nand its sacred beliefs. When their cousins are rampant, we say they’re\n‘brainwashed’ and that their groups are like ‘religions’ or ‘cults’.\n\nCults are the tightest games of all. They maintain their power by being the\nsole significant source of connection and status for their players. Earning a\nplace in a cult means actively following its belief system and adhering\nutterly to its game in thought and behaviour, allowing it to colonise your\nneural territory entirely. A true cult member has one active identity. Players\nattracted to them are often those who’ve failed at the games of conventional\nlife. Alienated, injured and in need, their brains seek a game that seems to\noffer certainty, in which connection and status can be won by following an\nabsolutely precise set of rules.\n\nThis was true of many members of a US cult known, for much of its existence,\nas Human Individual Metamorphosis. Its leader, Bonnie Nettles and her deputy,\nMarshall Applewhite, wove an incredible dream for their players in which, by\nfollowing their rules with unwavering precision, they’d find themselves\ngraduating to the ‘next level’ of existence, the ‘evolutionary level above\nhuman’. After a period of training, they’d be picked up by UFOs and flown to\nheaven, a place that was ‘real, that can be reached among those who attain to\nit’.\n\nNettles and Applewhite, who went by various names including Ti and Do, were\nseen by themselves and their disciples as the literal incarnations of God and\nJesus. They were sacred beings, the living symbols and absolute masters of\ntheir game. But when they met, in 1972, both had been alienated from the\nordinary games of life. Do’s sixteen-year marriage and career as a music\nprofessor had ended after accusations he’d had a sexual relationship with a\nmale student; Ti’s daughter recalls her mother gazing into the sky wishing a\nflying saucer would whisk her away: [‘Neither one\nof](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos861212) us felt that we were part of\nthis world. We were always on the outside looking in. We wanted something\ndifferent.’\n\nThey began teaching New Age subjects together and came to believe they were\nhigh-status people, no less than the ‘two witnesses’ described in the Bible’s\nBook of Revelation to whom God says he’ll ‘grant authority’ and will ‘prophesy\nfor twelve hundred and sixty days clothed in sackcloth’. They began\nproselytising; a small community of followers gathered around them. Many\nseemed disconnected from the games of the conventional world, just like Ti and\nDo. One recalled feeling, [‘alienated, hopeless,\nincomplete](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos861624) and utterly\nunsatisfied in this world no matter what I tried’.\n\nFor Ti and Do, none of the rules by which other humans played counted.\nProfessor of Religion Benjamin Zeller writes they [‘believed that\ntheir](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos861929) status as the two witnesses\nand the importance of their spiritual mission permitted them to violate human\nlaws’. The only valid rules were those they conjured into being. In order for\ntheir followers to be fit for entry into the Next Level, they had to\n‘literally overcome every human indulgence and human need’. This metamorphosis\nwould be ‘the most difficult task that there is … you have to lose everything.",

In order for\ntheir followers to be fit for entry into the Next Level, they had to\n‘literally overcome every human indulgence and human need’. This metamorphosis\nwould be ‘the most difficult task that there is … you have to lose everything.\nYou will sever every attachment with that world that you have.’ Players were\nrequired to inhabit the game entirely, using its criteria for claiming status\nto the exclusion of all others. This meant shedding past identities including\ntheir jobs, spouses, children, possessions and even their names: each\nindividual was rechristened with a six-letter moniker ending ‘ody’.\n\nIn 1976, eighty-eight men and women arrived in the remote Medicine Bow\nNational Forest in Wyoming to live and play a game that offered a reassuringly\nprecise path to otherworldly status. Failure to adhere to the rules wasn’t\ntolerated by Ti and Do: nineteen were expelled that year alone. Over the next\ntwo decades the game developed its own esoteric language: their home community\nwas the ‘craft’; bedrooms were ‘rest chambers’; kitchens ‘nutri-labs’;\nlaundries ‘fibre-labs’; bathrooms ‘bath chambers’; the body was the ‘vehicle’;\na bra was a ‘slingshot’; a fart was a ‘poofoofus’. Its many hundreds of rules\nwere recorded in ‘procedure books’. These dictated correct Next Level\nbehaviours, from what television shows could be watched, to how long you could\nspend in the bath (six minutes), to how much toothpaste you could use (enough\nto cover one quarter of the bristles), how men should shave their faces (down,\nnot up), how scrambled eggs should be cooked (‘totally dry but not browned’)\nand where you could poofoofus (hold it in and release in the bath chamber).\nTheir schedule was similarly precisely defined: daily vitamins were to be\nswallowed at 19:22. Gossiping and ‘chit chatting’ was banned, as was talking\nin a whisper. Knowingly breaking a procedure counted as a ‘major offence’,\nputting a player at risk of expulsion.\n\nA player’s neural territory had to be conquered completely by the imaginary\ngame of Human Individual Metamorphosis. Offences included: ‘having likes or\ndislikes’; ‘having inappropriate curiosity’; ‘having private thoughts’ and\n‘trusting my own judgment – or using my own mind’. If players felt an\nincorrect thought beginning to form they were to ‘put up a blank card’ and\nmove their mind to a correct place. [Former member Swyody\nrecalls](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos862226), ‘one could identify a\ntype of thought even before it became a thought. Before that, one would hear\nthe beginning of the thought and cut it short so the words actually don’t\nfinish in one’s brain.’ He also recounts being taught by Ti and Do that if\n‘they saw a tent as polka dotted, even if you disagreed, you would want to\nbelieve it is polka dotted and you would have to raise your vibrations to see\nit as they see it’. Then there was the Eyes Task. ‘We each had a clipboard and\nwe were assigned to watch our classmates and if they did or said anything we\nquestioned, or thought Ti and Do would want to know about, or broke any\nprocedure we were to record it. Ti and Do would read these each day.’\nContraventions of procedure were announced at regular ‘slippage meetings’.\nMembers would sit in a circle and publicly confess their ‘slips’. When others\nwould suggest what they could’ve done better, they had to say ‘thank you’. A\nwritten report of the confessions was sent to Ti and Do.\n\nFor Swyody, the most arduous struggle was the prohibition against sexual\nactivity or thought.",

A\nwritten report of the confessions was sent to Ti and Do.\n\nFor Swyody, the most arduous struggle was the prohibition against sexual\nactivity or thought. Correct procedure had it that players slept with their\nhands above their waist. When a ‘nocturnal emission’ occurred [during an\nerotic dream, correct](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos858809) procedure\nwas to clean yourself up with one of the hand-towels specifically reserved for\nthis purpose, each of which had to be signed out, so Ti and Do could be made\naware. Ashamed, Swyody sometimes found himself skipping this. Although he\nbecame proficient at putting a ‘blank card’ up to sexual thoughts, and\nstopping them before he’d had them, this eventually proved impossible: ‘when\nyou’ve been maintaining celibacy of mind and body for years, one can become\nquite the sensitive time bomb, to where even one thought can instantly cause\narousal’.\n\nA solution was suggested in 1987. Do called the men to a meeting. He told them\nthat a female member, Lvvody, had once worked as a nurse under a surgeon who’d\nperformed orchiectomies – removal of the testicles. She reckoned she knew how\nto do it. Do wasn’t ordering they be castrated, just pondering the\npossibility. Around this time, Swyody had entered a state of rivalry with\nanother player, Srrody. ‘His vehicle was Irish and a red head and he was quick\nas a fox in everything he did,’ he writes. Srrody was a ‘Johnny on the spot’\nalways too eager to please Ti and Do. ‘I had this thought that was sort of\ncompetitive with Srrody. I decided I would show Do how badly I wanted to be\ncastrated.’ When Do asked him if he had any reservations, he replied, ‘My\nvehicle isn’t looking forward to it, but I’m overriding my vehicle.’\n\nBut there was a problem. Srrody also wanted to be castrated. They decided on a\ncoin toss. To Swyody’s disappointment, Srrody won. Lvvody put a sign on the\ndoor of their makeshift surgery that read ‘Mexico’ so ‘if there was any\nproblem we could honestly say we went to Mexico to have the procedure done’.\nSrrody climbed on a table. Lvvody lifted his penis, shaved his scrotum and\ninjected it with local anaesthetic. Then she picked up a scalpel, made an\nincision and opened his scrotum up. ‘I got weak in the knees and almost passed\nout.’ Swyody was helped back up by Do, who said, ‘Well if this doesn’t bond\nus, nothing will.’ With the scrotum yawning, Lvvody reached in with her\nsurgical scissors, made some snips and plucked out both testicles. But once\nher patient was stitched up, he began to swell. ‘Srrody’s sack was as big as a\nbaseball.’ Swyody took him to hospital, telling the doctors the patient was a\nmonk who’d had the operation in Mexico. He healed perfectly. Too perfectly.\nSwyody became jealous. ‘I was disappointed that I didn’t have the procedure.’\n\nOver the coming months, Swyody’s sexual urges became more explosive than ever.\n‘I felt like I was plugged into a socket,’ he writes. ‘I didn’t even touch\nmyself and I had an orgasm and then another minutes later.’ Eventually, he\ngave up, and found himself with a masturbation habit. ‘I didn’t even have the\ndesire to change. It was like I was now a different person.’ In September\n1994, after nineteen years of loyal play, Swyody exited the cult that was now\ncalling itself Heaven’s Gate.",

After his departure, Do arranged for seven more\nmen, including himself, to be castrated, this time by real surgeons in real\nMexico.\n\nThe month Swyody left, Do gathered the group in a warehouse for a meeting.\nBack in 1985, their leader Ti had died of cancer. This was a severe challenge\nto the dream they’d woven for their followers to live and play in: Ti and Do\nwere supposed to personally and physically escort their followers onto the\nUFOs that would take them to the Next Level. Ti’s death led Do to revise the\nstory. He’d decided it was actually possible to ascend to the level above\nhuman having exited your body. They could graduate when dead. And so he had\nsomething to ask them. ‘What if we had to exit our vehicles by our own choice?\nDo we have a problem with that?’\n\nOnly one or two did. In March 1997, thirty-nine remaining members including Do\ncommitted suicide by swallowing barbiturates and vodka sweetened with\n‘pudding’, then tying bags over their heads. They killed themselves in three\nwaves, each cadre following the agreed procedure precisely, dressed\nidentically in grey shirts, dark tracksuit trousers and black-and-white Nike\nDecades. On their shoulders, they wore patches that said ‘Heaven’s Gate Away\nTeam’. The mass suicides became international news. Journalists descended upon\nthe area, trying to piece together their final days. The week prior to their\ndeparture to the Next Level, it was discovered they’d treated themselves to a\nlast supper at Marie Callender’s restaurant in Carlsbad. A bewildered waiter\ntold reporters: [‘They all\nordered](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos862663) the exact same thing.’\n\nThe conventional account of human life cannot explain Heaven’s Gate. When\ncalled upon to do so, we reach for the moral cartoon. Cult members are\n‘brainwashed’, trapped under the control of evil masterminds who are in it\nonly for sex or money. There’s no doubt cults do resort to aggressive means\nwhen members insult their sacred beliefs by not conforming sufficiently or\nseeking to leave, and that some leaders are motivated partly by crotch and\nwallet. But no cult could survive if it didn’t offer players something\ncritical. The members of Heaven’s Gate weren’t there because their brains had\nbeen washed; their brains were doing what brains naturally want to do.\n\nWe seek rules and symbols by which to play a status game. When we find one\nthat’s suitable, and that feels right, we’re vulnerable to absorbing its\nstory, no matter how berserk. This is true of the Satan-hunters, the anti-vax\nmothers, the yam growers of Pohnpei, ISIS, the online mobbers and religious\nadherents world over. One Heaven’s Gate veteran of thirteen years told\nresearchers, ‘We were protected. We didn’t like the rules of the world, so we\ncreated our own. It was a utopia.’ Brains want to know, who do I have to be to\nearn connection and status? Ti and Do wove a fantastic dream that offered\nprecise instructions, telling them exactly who to change into. And so that’s\nwhat they did.\n\nThere was little need for external cousins to police conformity: the cousins\nwere inside them. In his memoir, Swyody resorts to all caps to make this\npoint: ‘I WANTED TO BE IN TI AND DO’S PROGRAM AND WANTED TO ABIDE BY ALL THEIR\nRULES.",

[Not conforming] would be tantamount to wanting to be a NASA astronaut\nbut deciding this or that procedure didn’t need to be adhered to.’ Players\nwere so enthusiastic they’d call confessional ‘slippage meetings’ themselves.\nOne wrote, ‘We used to joke in the class that we were the cult of cults. We\nweren’t here to be programmed or brainwashed. We were here to beg to be\nbrainwashed.’ The thirty-nine killed themselves by choice. Sociologists Dr\nRobert Balch and Professor David Taylor write that [their deaths\n‘resulted](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos862976) from a deliberate\ndecision that was neither prompted by an external threat nor implemented\nthrough coercion. Members went to their deaths willingly, even\nenthusiastically, because suicide made sense to them in the context of [their]\nbelief system.’ This wasn’t death, it was victory; a glorious claiming of the\nstatus they’d earned of the level above human.\n\nTwo months after their deaths, a former member caught them up. After leaving\nthe group, Gbbody had been regretful over missing their departure to the Next\nLevel so he killed himself. Back in 1995, shortly after he’d quit, he’d\nwritten tenderly of his time with Heaven’s Gate: ‘more than anything else they\nwere my family. [I loved them\ndearly](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos863382). We were a tight group.’\n\n\n[22](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos5941)\n\n[Status Generating Machines](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos5941)\n\nSUCCESSFUL GROUPS ARE status generating machines. They thrive when they make\nstatus, both for their players and for the game itself. This is true in times\nof war and peace and in modes of tightness or looseness; it’s true in\npolitical games, in cults, in gangs, in goldrush movements, in corporations,\nin religions, in sports teams, in inquisitions, in mobs, in any game you might\nimagine. As we’ve learned, people need status: they look to their games to get\nit. A statusful woman or man who’s leading a major game can certainly seem\nall-powerful when they’re being cheered by hysterical crowds under blinding\nspotlights, gossiped about in world media and deferred to by platoons of\nacolytes. But the vision is deceptive: it’s the subordinates who are\nultimately in charge.\n\nLeaders rent their thrones from these subordinates. If their formal position\nat the heights is to be assured, and they’re to remain comfortable behind\ntheir giant desk, they must earn true status in the minds of their players.\nThis means succeeding in the grind of making status for the group, and\ndistributing it down through the hierarchy in ways that generally adhere to\nits rules. It might come in the form of titles or money or medals or secret\nknowledge or a ladder to heaven or the Level Above Human, or just simple\nappreciation. Even dictators have players to please, not least their military\nelites who ought to be rewarded if their reign of dominance is to continue. No\ngame – not even a cult – can survive when every player but one feels hopeless\nand useless.\n\nThe strategist of legend Niccolò Machiavelli knew this well. A successful\nprince, he counselled, should, ‘show his esteem for talent, actively\nencouraging the able men and honouring those who excel in their profession’.\nNaturally this munificence should extend to any player who belonged to his\nelite.

If they prove themselves sufficiently\nuseful, we might even allow them to lead us for a while.\n\nSuccessful leaders tell their players the same irresistible story: we deserve\nmore status and, under my direction, we’ll get it. The forty-fifth President\nof the United States, Donald Trump, told this story, by promising to ‘Make\nAmerica Great Again’; so did his predecessor Barack Obama by seeking to embody\n‘Hope’. Whilst the terrorist group ISIS used the dread machine of social media\nto terrify their enemies, they wove for themselves an altogether different\nfantasy. [One analysis of their](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos864404)\nglossy magazine Dabiq found only 5 per cent of its imagery featured violence;\nfar more prevalent was that depicting their glorious future in an ‘idealistic\ncaliphate’.\n\nBut stories of happy endings can be more seductive still when they’re menaced\nup the back end by the threat of rivals. When games feel their status is being\nendangered by foes, their players are more likely to join the battle in\nsupport of it and endorse leaders that show zeal for the fight. Researchers\nfind [rivalrous anger, when\ncombined](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos864706) with optimistic\nenthusiasm for the win, can be especially potent in motivating players: in\nstudies, when people read a political message that makes them feel highly\nangry or enthusiastic, [‘they want\nto](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos864998) jump into the ring’, writes\npolitical psychologist Dr Lilliana Mason. ‘They want to get involved.’ Threats\nfrom rival games help motivate by increasing the poisonous narrative of\nprejudice. [‘Without a threat](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos865270) to\na social group, members are less likely to derogate outgroups, and they have\nless of a motivation to improve the status of the group.’\n\nLoathe him or loathe him, Adolf Hitler was, for a time, one of the most\nsuccessful leaders in modern history. As historian Professor Ian Kershaw\nwrites, [‘few, if any](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos865545), twentieth-\ncentury political leaders have enjoyed greater popularity among their own\npeople than Hitler in the decade or so following his assumption of power’.",

Once again, it conflicts with our fundamental ideas about\nhuman nature. How could such a cultured and brilliant people have voted a\nviolent anti-Semite to be their leader? And then cheered him hysterically, in\nsquares crammed with thousands, as if he were a god? But, viewed from the\nperspective of the status game, the rise of the Nazis becomes explicable.\n\nAlready, our strange travels have brought us into the company of three mass-\nkillers: Elliot Rodger, Ed Kemper and Ted Kaczynski. All were grandiose,\nsecure in their entitlement to being treated as high-status individuals, but\nwho nevertheless suffered chronic and serious experiences of humiliation.\nHumiliation, as we’ve learned, is the ultimate psychological de-grading: the\n‘nuclear bomb of the emotions’ that can cause the ‘annihilation of the self’\nand lead to major depressions, suicidal states, psychosis, extreme rage and\nsevere anxiety. It’s also thought to be a propulsive force for honour killers\nwho similarly seek to restore their lost status with violence. And this is\njust what we find in pre-war Germany: the humiliation of the grand, but on the\nlevel of the nation.\n\nBefore the First World War, Germany had been the [wealthiest and most\nhighly](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos865839) developed society in\nEurope. Here was a nation in which ‘capitalist enterprise had reached an\nunprecedented scale and degree of organization’, writes historian Professor\nRichard Evans. [Germany produced two-\nthirds](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos866208) of all the steel in\ncontinental Europe, half its coal and 20 per cent more electricity than Italy,\nFrance and Britain combined. Many of its major industries – chemicals,\npharmaceuticals, electricity – were world leaders, its corporations, including\nSiemens, AEG, BASF, Hoechst, Krupps and Thyssen enjoying stellar reputations\nfor quality. Even their farmers were brilliantly successful: Germany grew a\nthird of the planet’s potatoes. Living standards had been soaring since the\ncentury’s start. As the war began, there’d been a widespread assumption of\nquick victory for the superior Germans, a view encouraged by fantastic\nvictories on the Eastern Front and the swift taking of Poland. Even when\nGermany suddenly and shockingly declared defeat, there’d been an expectation\nthat the terms of peace, in the Treaty of Versailles, would be fairly\nmeasured.\n\nThey weren’t. [‘No one was](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos866491)\nprepared for the peace terms to which Germany was forced to agree,’ writes\nEvans. It was [compelled to accept\n‘](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos866776)sole guilt’ for the conflict and\nresponsibility for its consequences. This meant: [surrendering vast tracts\nof](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos867052) land in Europe; renouncing\ntheir colonies elsewhere; handing over enormous piles of military equipment,\nincluding all their submarines; destroying six million rifles, over fifteen\nthousand aeroplanes and more than one hundred and thirty thousand machine\nguns; adhering to severe restrictions on future military activity, including\ntheir possessing only six battleships and no air force at all; paying the\nmodern equivalent of nearly three hundred billion pounds in cash reparations,\nplus copious booty including twenty-four million tonnes of coal. A ruinous\neconomic blockade of Germany was to continue.",

A ruinous\neconomic blockade of Germany was to continue. ‘These provisions were almost\nuniversally felt in Germany as an unjustified national humiliation.’\n\nBut there was more. As well as covering the costs of everyone else’s war, the\nGermans had to pay for their own. [The government had\nbeen](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos867368) expecting reparations and\nwealth from newly annexed industrial zones to flow inwards, rather than\noutwards, and had been printing and spending cash accordingly. Its defeat\nhelped trigger a state of hyperinflation so nightmarish it bordered on the\ncomic. Prices rose with such rapidity shopkeepers had to write them on\nblackboards: one newspaper reported that [a gramophone costing\nfive](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos867664) million marks at 10 a.m.\ncost twelve million five hours later. [A coffee at\na](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos867937) cafe might cost five thousand\nmarks when you ordered it and eight thousand when you’d finished. In August\n1922, one US dollar cost around 1,000 marks; [by December 1923\nthat](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos868206) same dollar cost\n4,200,000,000,000 marks. Workers were collecting wages in wheelbarrows. These\nhumiliations triggered yet further humiliations: [when Germany fell\nbehind](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos868508) on its reparations of gold\nand coal, the French and Belgians occupied their main industrial area, the\nRuhr, to seize what they were owed.\n\nHow could all this have happened? [‘The sense\nof](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos868808) outrage and disbelief that\nswept through the German upper and middle classes like a shock wave was almost\nuniversal,’ writes Evans. ‘Germany had been brutally expelled from the ranks\nof the Great Powers and covered in what they considered to be undeserved\nshame.’ Germany was superior, and Germans knew it. They looked at the ruined\nhierarchy and wove around it a self-serving story that said their defeat was\nengineered by powerful and sinister forces. Military leaders, among many\nothers, began claiming they’d been the victim of a [‘secret, planned,\ndemagogic](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos869107) campaign’ by deviants.\nIt was a time of gossip, accusation and moral outrage. The national culture\nhad tightened up for the First World War and, in its peril and shame, it never\nloosened. Germany [‘remained on a](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos869388)\ncontinued war footing; at war with itself, and at war with the rest of the\nworld, as the shock of the Treaty of Versailles united virtually every part of\nthe political spectrum in a grim determination to overthrow its central\nprovisions, restore the lost territories, end the payment of reparations and\nre-establish Germany as the dominant power in Central Europe once more.’\n\nAfter hyperinflation was brought under control, the Great Depression struck;\nby 1932 it was reported around [thirteen million\npeople](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos869669) were in out of work\nfamilies. Disillusionment with the capitalist system was now driving people in\never greater numbers to the Communists who, since the revolution in Russia,\nwere becoming an alarming and genuine threat, not least to the industrialists\nand middle classes who’d seen their equivalents in the East robbed and\ntortured, murdered and disappeared.

This was an era in which antisemitism was\nrelatively common throughout Europe. In their hunt for deviants, many Germans\naccepted a convenient illusion which said the Jews were to blame for the\ndepression and the Communist peril and the unjust loss of the First World War\nand all its attendant humiliations.\n\nThere were, at that time, [around 600,000\npractising](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos869932) Jews in the German\nEmpire. [Generally speaking, they\nwere](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos870201) a high-status group,\nupwardly mobile, successful economically and culturally, with prominent\nfamilies in finance and retail and prestigious Jewish names throughout the\nelite games of the arts, medicine, law, science and journalism. Stewing with\npowerful resentments, and the story that Germany was the victim of [a ‘Jewish-\nBolshevik](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos870495) conspiracy’, were [new\nscientific ideas about](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos870770) heredity:\ntheories about how unwanted traits might be bred out of the national gene pool\nfor the sake of Germany’s elevation. The nation had won major status in\nrevealing the causes of diseases including cholera and tuberculosis, which\ntriggered a surge in interest in matters of hygiene. These notions combined to\nform a noxious preoccupation with Germany’s ‘racial hygiene’ – and not just in\nplayers of the extreme right.\n\nBut whilst plenty of Germans blamed the Jews for their humiliation,\n[relatively few endorsed brutal](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos871058)\nactions against them. They were much more concerned with their glorious\njourney towards national order, unity and restored status. For Evans, [‘among\nordinary Party](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos871335) activists in the\n1920s and early 1930s, the most important aspect of Nazi ideology was its\nemphasis on social solidarity – the concept of the organic racial community of\nall Germans – followed at some distance by extreme nationalism and the cult of\nHitler. Antisemitism, by contrast, was of significance only for a minority,\nand for a good proportion of these it was only incidental.’ Aware of this,\nHitler made a public step away from antisemitism. [Prior to 1922\nhe](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos871640)’d been ranting about the Jews\npersistently; afterwards, and throughout most of the 1930s, [he raised the\n‘](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos871914)Jewish Question’ relatively\nrarely in his speeches. Incidents of antisemitic violence were viewed, by the\nmany, as [unfortunate but understandable\nflare](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos872216)-ups of overenthusiasm by a\nviolent fringe.\n\nFar more effective than racial hatred was the promise of future status.\n[Hitler’s party](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos872528) positioned itself\nas young and forward-thinking and in unique possession of the strength,\norganisation and zeal necessary to restore Germany’s rightful place. He wove a\nfantastic dream that millions of intended voters found irresistible: they were\nmembers of an elite Aryan master race, [‘the Prometheus\nof](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos873002) mankind, out of whose bright\nforehead springs the divine spark of genius at all times’. The story he told\nof the status game was that race, not class, was what mattered: [‘there are\nno](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos873269) such things as classes: they\ncannot be.

Under his leadership they’d rise to ever greater heights in the form\nof a glorious thousand-year Aryan kingdom: the Third Reich.\n\n[‘Finally a practical](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos873988) proposal\nfor the renewal of the people!’ said one 18-year-old supporter in 1929.\n‘Destroy the parties! Do away with classes! True national community! These\nwere goals to which I could commit myself, without reservation.’ On 5 March\n1933, Hitler’s party won the election, albeit with less than 50 per cent of\nthe vote. The Nazis quickly began imposing the rules and symbols of their game\nonto the nation at large. Propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels declared Germany\nhad [‘to think as](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos874293) one, to react\nas one, and to place itself in the service of the government with all its\nheart’. On 21 March [the Malicious Practices\nAct](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos874571) was introduced. It compelled\n‘every nationally minded’ person to report to the authorities anyone\n‘responsible [for] any insulting of the Reich government or any degradation of\nthe national revolution’.\n\nJust three weeks after the election, Goebbels informed radio broadcasters that\n[nonconformists would be ‘](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos874857)purged’\nfrom their stations: they were to cleanse their staff of undesirables\nthemselves or have it done for them. The removal of ideological enemies and\nJews from positions of status continued: incorrect-thinking university\n[professors, artists, writers,\njournalists](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos875114) and scientists,\nincluding twenty past or yet-to-be Nobel laureates, Albert Einstein and Erwin\nSchrödinger among them, were dismissed. The game was tightening to a Heaven’s\nGate level of extremity: players were to earn Nazi status or no status at all.\nCousins and warriors ran rampant. Just as in the tight days of the Spanish\nInquisition, a wave of denunciation began, often triggered by personal\ngrudges, which created an [‘atmosphere of\nintimidation](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos875390) and vigilance\nagainst a careless remark which prying ears might seize upon’. The day after\nthe election, the [Communist Party was\nformally](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos875661) banned. By the end of\nthe year, members numbering at least in the tens of thousands had been\nimprisoned or killed, a [‘massive, brutal\nand](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos876216) murderous assault’ predicated\non the belief they’d been mounting a revolution. [Soon, all other\npolitical](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos876499) parties were banned.

In his [first address to\nthe](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos877344) media after taking office,\npropaganda chief Goebbels told journalists: [‘There are\ntwo](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos877664) ways to make a revolution.\nYou can blast your enemy with machine guns until he acknowledges the\nsuperiority of those holding the machine guns. That is one way. Or you can\ntransform the nation through a revolution of the spirit, and instead of\ndestroying your enemy, win him over.’ And so the Nazis played both strategies.\n\nSpreading a game throughout society means controlling the smaller games that\nmake it up: the bureaucracies, communities, media hubs and clubs, everywhere\npeople play by rules to make status. The universities were already theirs,\n[the ‘vast majority](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos877941) of\nprofessors’ being ‘strongly nationalist’ and antisemitic. Respected university\nstaff who didn’t conform [were replaced by\n‘](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos878251)often mediocre figures whose\nonly claim to their new position was that they were Nazis and enjoyed the\nsupport of the Nazi students’ organization’, writes Evans. They were teaching\nstudents who were [‘an elite to](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos878536)\nwhich racism, antisemitism and ideas of German superiority were almost second\nnature’. These ambitious warriors [‘organized campaigns\nagainst](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos878820) unwanted professors in\nthe local newspapers, staged mass disruptions of their lectures and led\ndetachments of stormtroopers in house-searches and raids’. In May 1933, they\nheld a coordinated ‘act against the un-German spirit’ across numerous\nuniversities, removing books from libraries they deemed politically incorrect\nand burning them in piles.\n\nBut the universities weren’t enough: the rules and symbols of the Nazis had to\ncolonise every game possible, replacing the old criteria for claiming status\nwith the new. By the end of 1933, the [Hitler Youth accommodated\nover](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos879113) two million adolescents. By\n1935 membership had almost doubled and in 1939 it was required legally for\nchildren over 10. [The Nazis staffed\ntheir](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos879388) enormous social welfare\nadministration with professionals who believed in concepts of racial purity,\nbeliefs which radiated through the powerful bureaucracies of medicine, law\nenforcement, and the prison system. [Voluntary associations in\nevery](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos879690) village, town and city went\nthrough a process of Nazification; the party itself established local games,\nwith organisations at the regional, district and local levels [‘staffed with\nloyal](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos879969) and energetic\nfunctionaries, many of them well educated and administratively competent’; a\nNazi women’s organisation was founded, as were special groups for civil\nservants, farmers and the war-wounded, ‘and for many other constituencies,\neach addressing its particular, specifically targeted propaganda effort’.

Writes historian and marketing researcher\nProfessor Nicholas O’Shaughnessy, [‘the Nazis\noffered](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos880604) something for everyone’.\nJust as during the goldrush of the Satanic Panic, these groups were status\ngames, acting as accelerators for the rules and symbols of Nazi play.\n\nFor most Germans, the Nazi game became the only one that could offer\nsignificant status. Within months of Hitler’s appointment to the\nChancellorship, [party membership\ntripled](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos880884) to two and a half million\n– so many that a moratorium on joining had to be announced. By 1939 ‘at least\none-half and most likely two-thirds of all Germans’ belonged to some Nazi\norganisation. ‘Membership was key to upward career and social mobility. With\nits dense network of organisations, the Nazi Party created a host of well-paid\nfunctionary and around two million prestigious volunteer positions.’ Once\nindividuals start to play and begin to enjoy a game’s rewards, it becomes part\nof their identity. They come to rely on it, to defend it, to evangelise it.\nAnd so the game becomes self-supporting, self-reinforcing, as each individual\nplayer now requires it to be real and true in order for their status to be\nreal and true. The tyrannical cousins roar forth in their behaviour. As the\ngoldrush grows, the game attracts new players, drawn to its increasingly\nsplendid rewards; as it becomes more powerful, more and greater status is made\navailable; it becomes larger and more powerful still.\n\nThere’s a critical warning in all this: tyrants often start by telling you\nwhat you already believe. When they arrive, they weave their irresistible\nself-serving dream, promising that you deserve more status, just as you’d\nalways suspected, and pointing accusingly at those you’d already figured to be\nyour enemies – child abusers, conversos, big business, Communists, Jews. They\nmake accusation and gossip; you become angry, enthusiastic and morally\noutraged. You begin to play. Once they’ve got you, they tighten up. Their\nbeliefs become more extreme, more specific and are policed more severely;\nsecond-self tactics of dominance are widely deployed. The most tyrannical\ngames – cults and fundamentalist political and religious movements – insist on\ncomplete conformity in thought and deed; their dream of reality colonising\nyour neural territory entirely. They seek to become a player’s sole source of\nstatus; no rival games are easily tolerated. On the scale of the nation, which\nrequires other games to exist in forms such as universities, the media and\nstate bureaucracies, all must become subservient: no matter where games take\nplace, status is rewarded for play that serves the tribe, whilst dreadful\nconsequences await suspected deviants.\n\nNone of this would’ve succeeded if Hitler hadn’t created status for his\nplayers. If it seems reprehensible to face the Nazi regime’s apparent\n‘successes’, it’s because we tell a sacred story about its monstrousness:\nanything that sounds even dimly positive rings the alarms of taboo. But we\nmust be brave. Monsters exist only in the imagination. The Nazi catastrophe\ncan’t be understood without acknowledgement of why the Germans came to worship\ntheir leader as a god and how they achieved the aims of Goebbels who stated,\non their election in 1933, that they’d win over doubters by working on them\n[‘until they have](../Text/index_split_038.html#filepos881143) become addicted\nto us’.",

We made them clean out the toilets, smeared them with black paint\nand organised “control monster teams” to see that it was done properly … It\ntook nearly a week of constant struggle to make [a teacher] admit he had said\n“Mao was wrong” in conversation … After about two weeks, we were afraid that\nthe literature teacher would kill herself. We kept her under constant\nsurveillance and even wrote a poster and attached it to the mosquito net over\nher bed reminding her that she was being watched and could not succeed in\ncommitting suicide.’ Dai’s biographers note he ‘admitted to enjoying this\nsheer cruel fun of humiliating [the] power holders, particularly the\nprincipal.

It happened again and again:\nNazis publicly [cut their hair,\nshaved](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos900091) their beards, paraded them\nwith their trousers cut off and with signs around their necks, made them drink\n[dangerous quantities of castor](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos900315)\noil, [ordered them to carry](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos900589) out\npointless tasks such as carrying mattresses back and forth, endlessly building\nand rebuilding walls and squatting with heavy logs.\n\nJust as for the cultural revolutionaries in China, forcing their targets to\nclean was a favourite activity for the Nazis.

Still today, [one in ten\nglobal](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos902700) marriages are between\nrelatives including cousins.\n\nBut virtue and dominance aren’t the only way humans evolved to make status. We\ncan also use strategies of success. In the tribes in which we evolved, it was\npossible to earn rank by being useful to others with displays of competence:\nthe best hunter, the best sorcerer, the best finder of honey. The modern world\nis heavily flavoured by the success games of scientists, technologists,\nresearchers, corporations and creatives. Their status is won not by showing\nand enforcing moral correctness, but by becoming smarter, wealthier and more\ninnovative and efficient.\n\nModernity was made in the West. There are many answers to the question of why\nthis might be and none of them, it should hardly be necessary to note, involve\nthere being anything inherently superior about those born on this chunk of the\nplanet. The reasons are complex. [Partly it has\nto](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos902979) do with lucky geography:\nclimactic conditions that benefitted early crop farmers and keepers of\nlivestock. Wheat, barley, sheep and cattle accelerated the process of settling\ndown, accumulating wealth and dividing labour into caste-based specialisms.\nElsewhere, researchers hunting [the roots of\nWestern](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos903256) individualism look to\nAncient Greece. They, too, note its geography: it was a pointillist\ncivilisation formed of around one thousand city states, dotted about many\ncoasts and craggy islands in which large-scale farming was mostly impossible.\nThis compelled people to get by, not as obedient members of agrarian\ncommunities, but as entrepreneurs: fishermen, makers of pottery, tanners of\nhides. The Ancient Greeks were self-starters who’d be regularly exposed to\ntraders with new perspectives from other communities, even distant continents.\nThis encouraged success-inflected games of individual ability and debate. From\nthese games emerged an ideal of self, based on the all-powerful individual,\nthat remains characteristic of Western culture.\n\nBut such accounts are only part of the answer. Another factor can be found by\nbuckling up for an intense ride through the history of the status games of\nmonotheism and money. Across the world, wealth and the great religions\nconstituted major threats to the dominant powers of King, Queen and Emperor.\nThe rise of holy leaders and rich traders saw new elites emerge, leading rival\ngames. But it was in the West that success games first managed to overpower\nthe old virtue games, and come to flower over a culture.\n\nThis happened not as a result of strategy or guile, but of chance and\nunintended consequence. It’s a process that demonstrates how powerful the\ngames we play for status can be in defining self, culture and history.\nIndividuals want to know: who do I have to be to get along and get ahead?\nThose born in an environment of dominance, virtue and obedience to caste and\nkin will become those people and play those games.

These success games became a goldrush that spread across Western Europe,\nthe USA and then the rest of the world. They changed everything. They were our\nroad out of hell.\n\nAnd they might never have come about if it wasn’t [for the Catholic\nChurch](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos903638)’s weird preoccupation with\nincest. Over a period of more than a thousand years, [starting in AD\n305](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos903945), the Church instituted a\nseries of rule changes that combined to disable the old inward-looking virtue\ngames, based on kin and extended family, and compel people to play in new\nways. It banned: polygamous marriage; marriage to blood relatives including up\nto sixth cousins; marriage to in-laws, including that of uncles to nieces and\nmen to stepmothers and stepdaughters. It also suppressed forced marriages,\nencouraged newlyweds to set up their own households away from the extended\nfamily and promoted individual inheritance by will and testament, rather than\nthe automatic handing-down of assets to the clan. It would take many\ncenturies, but by the accident of its unholy obsession, it was to change the\ngame forever.\n\nThese rule alterations and their historical effects were discovered by Joseph\nHenrich, a Professor of Human Evolutionary Biology. He and his colleagues have\nproduced an impressive constellation of evidence in support of them. Henrich\nargues [these changes\n‘systematically](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos904428) broke down the\nclans and kindreds of Europe into monogamous nuclear families’. People were\nforced to seek status outside their kin networks and play with strangers.\n[Learning to ‘navigate](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos904734) a world\nwith few inherited ties’ meant developing a novel psychology, and so the\ncoding of their game-playing machines was rewritten. They made games for\nthemselves in which ‘success and respect’ depended on ‘honing one’s own\nspecial attributes; attracting friends, mates, and business partners with\nthese attributes and then sustaining relationships with them’. Crucially,\nHenrich’s research shows the Catholics’ new rules were causative in changing\nwho we were: [the longer a\npopulation](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos905021) lived by them, the\nlooser their kinship groups and the more they became outward-looking,\nnonconformist, trusting of outsiders, self-focussed and individualistic.\n\nThis mass psychological recoding was only possible in the first place because\nthe major religions had insinuated their dream of the game into the minds of\nmillions.

[God couldn’t](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos905883) be\nworshipped by sacrifice, like pagan gods, but by ‘proper belief’, writes New\nTestament researcher Professor Bart Ehrman. ‘Anyone who didn’t believe the\nright things would be considered a transgressor before God.’ Punishments for\nincorrect belief were as severe as an imagination could allow: an endless\ndegrading in the torments of hell. Its tortures, often based around the body\nbeing ’[eternally burned, without](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos906307)\nbeing consumed’ were threatened in sermons such as this, from Saint Leonard:\n‘Fire, fire: such is the reward for your perversity, you stubborn sinners.\nFire, fire, the fire of hell. Fire in your eyes, fire in your mouth, fire in\nyour bowels, fire in your throat, fire in your nostrils, fire within, fire\nwithout, fire below, fire above, fire all about. Ah, wretches, you will be\nlike burning embers in the middle of this fire.’ Unbelief could also mean\ndropping in status in the here and now, with sometimes all-too-real\nconsequences: if the faithless didn’t suffer outright persecution, they were\noften denied legal and social privileges and, [in some Muslim\ncommunities](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos906609), paid higher taxes.\nThe reward for playing was connection and status in this life, and infinite\nparadise in the next. [‘Religion had\nnever](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos906910) promoted such an idea\nbefore,’ writes Ehrman. ‘Christians created a need for salvation that no one\nknew they had. They then argued that they alone could meet the need. And they\nsucceeded massively.’\n\nBy the medieval era, the Catholic Church had become [the most powerful\ninstitution](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos907301) on earth; its leader\nthe most powerful human alive.

Some inevitably doubted and many played a double game,\nstill honouring the old polytheistic traditions (many of which were\nregurgitated by Christianity, with its buffet of saints and its hopscotching\nof pagan feast days). But hope in heaven and dread of hell certainly seem real\nand widespread: the wealthy gave so much to the Church, to buy themselves a\nbetter afterlife, secular leaders enacted laws to limit their spending.\n\nCatholicism was a virtue-dominance game in which players required God’s mercy\nto drag themselves off the bottom: [‘What is\na](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos908214) man by himself, without grace?\nA being more evil than the demon,’ wrote Saint Catherine of Genoa. Life was a\ngame for status that was mostly won in the eternity; where you ended up was a\nmatter of how well you played. The rules were slightly complicated. God, being\never-loving, granted mercy to all believers, but players had to demonstrate\ntheir acceptance of his generous offer by performing good works on earth.\n[‘The tricky thing](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos908479)’, writes\nhistorian Professor Peter Marshall, ‘was knowing whether one had done enough\nto count as an unqualified “yes” to God’s invitation.’ For many terrified\npeople, this question became an obsession. By the late medieval, it’s argued,\na ‘widespread and morbid’ sense of ‘salvation anxiety’ had taken hold of much\nof the Christian world.\n\nIn salvation anxiety, the Church smelled opportunity. The Pope claimed the\nability to guarantee someone’s place in heaven, by drawing from the ‘surplus’\ngood deeds of the saints as currency. He began issuing letters, called\nindulgences, that would forgive sins and ease a person’s passage in the\nafterlife. First intended as bribes to persuade men to join the Crusades\nagainst the Church’s Muslim rivals, they soon became a way of gathering\nrevenue, not least for the building of conspicuous status symbols such as\nchurches and cathedrals. A market for indulgences grew, in which forgiveness\n[for sins including cousin](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos908735)\nmarriage could be bought. They even sold [forgiveness for future\nsins](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos908999).

Some worked the land for a Lord of the Manor; others moved into\ntowns and cities. Further encouraged out of the countryside by wars and\nplagues, they found themselves populating streets, markets and squares,\nmingling with strangers with whom they’d have to sustain fruitful, trusting,\nprofessional relationships.\n\nThe business of getting along and getting ahead had been changing.\nUniversities had been founded, [with more than\nfifty](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos909525) established by 1500,\nproducing lawyers, writers, mathematicians, logicians and astronomers.\nCraftsmen, now freer to choose an occupation based on individual preference\nrather than accident of birth, formed professional guilds. Guilds were success\ngames. They sprang up around all manner of trades, including blacksmiths,\nbrewers, weavers, glassmakers, dyers, shoemakers, locksmiths, bakers and\nskinners. Each had their own set of rules and symbols by which they awarded\nsuccess-based status, with members granted the title ‘master craftsman’.\nAmbitious young players apprenticed themselves to a master, [learned a trade,\njoined](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos909814) the game, before moving on\nto another master to learn more. As expertise developed, demand for quality\ngoods increased. A [‘work ethic’](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos910112)\ncame into being, in which toil itself became prestigious. ‘This shift can be\nunderstood as the beginning of a work-centred society’, writes historian\nProfessor Andrea Komlosy, ‘in which the diverse activities of all of its\nmembers are increasingly obliged to take on the traits of active production\nand strenuous exertion.’\n\nWe were getting our status from new kinds of games. Slowly, and in fits and\nstarts, our focus had been juddering from duty to the clan towards individual\ncompetence and success. This changed our psychology, rewriting the cultural\ncoding of our game-playing brains, turning us into new sorts of humans. We\nwere more independent, more self-focussed, more outward-looking, more\ninterested in personal excellence, [less conformist and\nless](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos910397) in awe of tradition,\nancestry, duty and authority. In short, we were no longer the kind of people\nprepared to be bullied, threatened, bribed and insulted by a corrupt and\nstatus-drunk Church. By the sixteenth century the Catholic Church, and the\npsychological nature of its players, had grown apart. Something would have to\ngive.\n\nIt gave in October 1517. The Pope had been selling indulgences to raise funds\nfor the building of yet another gaudy status symbol, St Peter’s Basilica in\nRome. Sales in Germany were headed up by a pushy friar, [Tetzel the\nPersuader](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos910681), whose pitch went: ‘as\nsoon as the coin in the coffer rings, a soul from purgatory to heaven\nsprings’.

He and other thinkers, most famously John Calvin, disagreed on\nmuch, but eventually a new form of Christian game, for ‘Protestants’, came\ninto being. It had a revised set of rules and symbols, one fit for the\nsuccess-focussed player of town, university, guild and marketplace.\n\nFor Protestants, life was no longer a gruelling test for heaven or hell. God\nalready knew where you were ending up. [Believers were to\nlook](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos911486) for clues of ‘assurance’ to\nsee if they were saved or damned: signs of ‘elect status’ could be found in\ntheir own personal behaviour such as virtuous and sober living, but also in\nthe accrual of wealth and rank on earth. Believers were said to have a\npersonal ‘calling’. God had endowed them with special talents that they should\nseek to maximise by choosing the right occupation or vocation, then working\nhard in it. Those acting with toil and self-discipline in a freely chosen game\nwere allowing God’s gift to flourish. Playing for personal success became\nholy, an act of worship. With a few hundred years of hindsight, we can see\nthese cultural innovations for what they are: a long step towards modernity.\n\nBut the changes didn’t stop there. No longer was a Christian’s relationship\nwith God to be mediated by an elite caste of clergy: [‘we are\nall](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos911765) equally priests’, wrote\nLuther. Players would learn to read Bibles themselves, translated from the\nLatin. A sacred virtue was made of education: [reading\nwasn’t](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos912039) merely encouraged, it was\na foundational rule of the game, necessary for developing individual moral\nbehaviour and building a personal relationship with God. This single rule\nchange seems to have helped encourage a further massive alteration to our\npsychology. And once again, research suggests the change was causative.\nAnalysis by Henrich finds literacy rates grew [‘fastest in\ncountries](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos912335) where Protestantism was\nmost deeply established’. For centuries after Luther’s death, more Protestants\nin any country meant higher rates of literacy.\n\nThe Protestants’ remixed religion spread rapidly throughout Western Europe,\nthrough populations of relatively self-focussed players, drained by salvation\nanxiety and no longer prepared to be conned and insulted by their elites.

Catholics and Protestants went to war; in some places they’re still\nfighting.\n\nBut virtue games were still in charge. As radical as the Protestant game\nseems, for these deeply religious people ‘success’ wasn’t categorically\nseparate from ‘virtue’ but an extension of it. They were awarding status for\nshows of competence but still in the context of, and heavily mediated by, a\npowerful Christian virtue game. Ultimately, whether it was priests, bishops\nand popes in charge, or princes, dukes and kings, these were still games of\nobedience and duty. If the new-style success-oriented players were to ever\noverwhelm the entrenched authorities, they’d need to form powerful elites of\ntheir own. They’d do so by becoming rich.\n\nFor centuries leading up to Luther’s revolution, wealth had given players from\nnon-holy and non-royal castes a route to high social rank. These new elites\nthrived on the profits of status-striving. In the middle centuries of the last\nmillennium, trading routes into Asia, Africa, Indonesia and the Americas made\nfashionable the use of luxury [high-value goods\nsuch](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos913221) as spices, silks, sugar,\nopium, cannabis, velvet, ebony, ivory, sandalwood, tulips, coconuts, colourful\ndyes, bananas, papayas, rhubarb, potatoes, pineapples, sex toys and perfumes\nof musk and civet. Slaves were also traded. Meanwhile, Europe exported the\ngoods made by skilled craftsmen such as textiles, timber, glassware and paper.\nThe merchants who ran these operations became wealthy, often fabulously so.\nSome merchant families began funding expeditions by offering credit to\nadventurers in return for repayment with interest. These ‘merchant bankers’\nalso became wealthy, even more fabulously so. There was social mobility:\nambitious entrepreneurs without significant financial resources could start\ntheir careers travelling with cargo on such expeditions, earn capital, then\nmove up the trading game. Eventually trading companies recruited their own\nprivate armies and founded colonies in distant continents.\n\nRiches generated by trade; the rise of middle-class artisans and craftsmen;\nthe Black Death leaving resources to be spread around fewer people; games\nbeing played for competence and success: it all added up to more money washing\ndown through the game.

In England, [in 1363, legislation\nwas](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos913714) introduced to curb ‘the\nOutragious and Excessive Apparel of divers People, against their Estate and\nDegree, to the great Destruction and Impoverishment of all the Land’. It\ndefined what those of different ranks, from carters, oxherds and ploughmen all\nthe way up to knights, could spend on clothing. Other legislation forbade the\n[‘outrageous consumption of](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos914004) meats\nand fine dishes’ by some and ordered that ‘no knight under the estate of a\nlord, esquire or gentleman, nor any other person, shall wear any shoes or\nboots having spikes or points which exceed the length of two inches, under the\nforfeiture of forty pence’. [In 1574, one\nLondoner](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos914408) was imprisoned for the\ncrime of wearing ‘a pair of hose lined with taffety, and a shirt edged with\nsilver contrary to the ordinances’. It wasn’t only in the West that the rise\nof the wealthy, and their symbols of status, were creating anxieties for the\nold elites. One Chinese writer in 1591 complained that [‘a family\nwithout](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos914661) as much as an old broom\ngo about in carriages … and dress themselves up in the hats and clothing of\nthe rich and eminent’.\n\nAmong the world’s wealthiest regions were the trading cities in present-day\nItaly: Genoa, Florence and Venice. These were not the societies of sharply\ndivided inequality that were seen in earlier eras, in which elites played in\nan exalted distance far above the gruelling toil of the masses. Their success\ngames generated a healthy middle class, including artisans and shopkeepers;\ninequality is thought to have been [roughly comparable with\nmodern](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos914924) day USA. With this\nrelatively equal society came a new kind of culture in which elite players,\nfinding it harder to distinguish themselves, had to continually find fresh\nways to signal their status. They used expressions of taste and beauty, in\ngardens, squares, houses, sculpture, furnishings and personal appearance. This\nfed a market for yet more success games – for [painters, sculptors,\narchitects, potters](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos915179) and makers of\nhair extensions and false teeth. One poet of the time, [Giovanni Pontano, even\nwrote](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos915482) a treatise on the virtue of\nspending money in pursuit of private enjoyment.\n\nThis modern aspiration for luxury and elegance can be seen most clearly in\nItalian status play around food. In other parts of Europe, habits of dining\nremained basic. One 1530 book of etiquette, by Erasmus of Rotterdam, describes\ndiners sitting down to a goblet and helping themselves to communal meat using\nthe knife they carried with them daily. Plates were relatively rare and tended\nto be made of pewter; more often you’d eat off a thick piece of bread.\nEveryone, even kings and queens, ate with their hands.

The nobility and middle classes of its rich\ntrading cities were eating off porcelain plates using forks, knives and\nspoons. [In 1475 one Florence](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos916155)\nbanker ordered a set of four hundred glass beakers; [a single banquet\nin](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos916416) 1565 made use of 150 plates\nand fifty bowls ‘all of porcelain’. Wealthy merchant and noble families\ncollected services made up of hundreds of individual pieces. Historian\nProfessor Richard Goldthwaite writes, ‘the preparation of food, along with\nmanners, entered into the game of competition for status in a society\nincreasingly conscious of hierarchy’. Foreign visitors could find Italian food\nculture lavish and preposterous. French intellectual Montaigne thought it\nremarkable that diners were issued napkins and their own set of silverware.\nOne Italian chef he encountered ‘gave me a discourse on this science of\nsupping with a grave and magisterial countenance, as if he were speaking of\nsome grand point of theology … he unravelled the differences in appetite for\nme … after that, he embarked on the order of the courses, full of important\nand fine considerations … and all this bloated with grand and magnificent\nwords, such as one might use in describing the government of an empire.’\n\nBut as powerful as the success games of the artisans and traders were, their\ncultures were still ruled by the virtue games of religion and nobility. They\nremained essentially backwards-facing: whether it was the Bible or the ancient\nclassics that Italy’s elite saw as an aid to moral improvement and employment\npotentialities, the belief held that solving problems in the present meant\nconsulting the wisdom of the past.\n\nBut then, in the West, that began to change. Many centuries earlier, the\nChristian elites had started rewiring its players to become more open and less\nin awe of their own groups. This gave Westerners an increased openness to\nnovel ideas. Whilst the inward-looking [East adopted relatively\nfew](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos916726) Western technologies and\nnotions, the West was voracious in appropriating theirs – as the Italian love\nof eating off ‘china’ indicates. It wasn’t only their beautiful, delicious and\nintoxicating goods we imbibed, it was their genius, including [the Hindu-\nArabic numeral](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos917018) system of zero to\nnine and its calculation and accountancy applications: decimal points,\naddition, subtraction, multiplication, division, principles of interest and\nbills of exchange.\n\nThis openness to novel ideas became a status-making pursuit. [At first in\nItaly](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos917282) in the 1500s, and then\nacross Western Europe, there spread a fashion for possessing ‘useful\nknowledge’. [In the beginning,\nthis](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos917544) manifested as ‘an upper\nclass fascination with learning and the arts, combining the features of the\nscholar and gentleman into a serious if perhaps somewhat amateurish\nintellectual’, writes economic historian Professor Joel Mokyr. These gentleman\nthinkers, known as ‘virtuosi’, wrote books on subjects as disparate as\nforestry, mathematics and sumptuary laws. Their success-play was founded on a\nlove of knowledge for its own sake. The virtuosi, ‘turned curiosity, once\nregarded as a vice, into a virtue’.",

[Showing knowledge had\nbecome](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos917845) a status symbol: ‘the\ncourtier had become a scholar, and culture for social ornament passed into\nlearning for fame and admiration’.\n\nAs the dreams of the virtuosi spread downwards from the nobility towards a\nbroader expanse of intellectuals, a significant status game formed around new\nand useful knowledge. Named by the Venetian statesman and thinker Francesco\nBarbaro as the Respublica Literaria, or Republic of Letters, this game was\nmade possible by the postal system that had been established across much of\nWestern Europe. Men and women of excellence were now able to communicate their\nideas in pamphlets, periodicals, books and personal correspondence. Their\nexpertise ranged across disciplines including medicine, science, philosophy,\ntheology, astronomy and philology. They created an international success game\nin which major status was awarded for dazzling displays of competence.\n\nMerely mastering the knowledge of the past was of little value in this game.\nEarning status was about the new: progress, innovation, insight and\noriginality. The financial rewards could be significant: the best players\nearned [patronage by dukes,\nprinces](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos918121) and kings, who’d boast of\nhaving the finest minds in their employ, and make profitable use of their\nexpertise in their state-building; merchants similarly recruited\nmathematicians and engineers to help give them an edge. But money wasn’t the\ndriving force of the Republic of Letters. [As Mokyr writes,\n‘](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos918851)reputation based on peer\nevaluation was what counted … to be recognised by one’s peers as a master is\nenormously desirable and this was the driving motive behind most scholarly\neffort in early modern Europe’. [Players could win\nmajor](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos919158) status by becoming\ninternational superstars, their fame spanning the continent, and have their\ndiscoveries – laws, methods, processes, astral bodies, parts of the brain and\nbody – named after them.\n\nThe rules by which the Republic’s game was played reads like a manifesto for\nthe future of science and technology. [Rather than jealously\nprotecting](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos919426) their ideas, players\nwould be open with them; knowledge was seen as a common good, but originators\nof new ideas could rightfully profit from them; intellectual debts would be\nacknowledged, the theft of ideas being disgraceful; letters should be\nresponded to; new ideas could and should be contested; there were to be no\nboundaries of kin, clan, nation or religion. A ‘scientific method’ for the\ntesting of theories was developed that, wrote one scholar, [‘teaches men\nhumility](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos919713) and acquaints them with\ntheir own errors and so removes all overweening haughtiness of mind’. Strict\nstandards would be applied to these experiments: there should be unbiased\nanalysis of data; accurate records kept; they should be reproducible; results\nshould be published.\n\nThe establishment of the Republic of Letters is a major event in human\nhistory. It earns its notch on the ruler of time alongside fire and campsites,\ngossip and reputation and rise of empires and conquering religions. It takes\ntwo electrical wires, jams them together and makes an explosion that blasts us\ninto a new epoch. The first live wire was our capacity for culture.",

It earns its notch on the ruler of time alongside fire and campsites,\ngossip and reputation and rise of empires and conquering religions. It takes\ntwo electrical wires, jams them together and makes an explosion that blasts us\ninto a new epoch. The first live wire was our capacity for culture. Humans had\nbeen able to conquer the planet partly because we exist in a web of stored\ninformation. Every individual born didn’t have to learn everything for\nthemselves afresh: knowledge was communicated by elders and passed down\nthrough the generations. But in the old kin-based virtue games, this knowledge\noften just bounced around the group. The ideas of other collectives were\ntypically of little interest. Innovation never sat well in these virtue games,\nwhere worship of ancestry and the wisdom of the past dominated a player’s\nthoughts. As problems were encountered and solved, innovation naturally took\nplace, but not often for its own sake. In the era of virtue games, aside from\nrelatively rare bursts here and there, progress was usually slow.\n\nThe second live wire was status from success. Human brains want to know, Who\ndo I need to become to win rank? In Pohnpei, a success game evolved around the\ngrowing of enormous yams. The result was enormous yams. In the Republic of\nLetters, a success game evolved around our capacity for accumulating\nknowledge. The result was enormous accumulations of knowledge. We’d win by\nmaking correct observations and predictions about reality and storing what\nwe’d learned in letters, pamphlets and books, allowing it to build and become\neven more useful, being adapted and improved by other players. The Republic’s\nrules were such that findings were freely shared and judged by peers; winners\nwere reliably celebrated, moving up in rank. It was a beautifully constructed\nsuccess game. Its players couldn’t know it, but the Republic of Letters was\nriding on ancient circuitry that had evolved to help co-operative hunter-\ngatherer tribes survive. By connecting our ability to accumulate knowledge to\nour desire for status, they’d discovered the future.\n\nBut the future wasn’t ready for them yet. The Republic of Letters was tiny; a\ngame played by a narrow elite of intellectuals and nobles. It wasn’t nearly\npowerful enough to insinuate itself into the minds of millions and define a\nculture, as kingdoms, empires and the great faiths had done. The kin-based\nvirtue games of royalty and religion jealously maintained their dominance; the\nempires struck back. In Italy the old elites eventually re-established their\ndominion over the new. In Venice, entrepreneurial merchants and bankers were\nshut out of The Great Council, its centre of political power. [The Council was\ncolonised](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos919991) by a hereditary\naristocracy who then ate away at the traders’ ability to create wealth,\nleading to the city’s decline.\n\nBut there was one place in the world in which the old orders failed to\nrestrain the new: Britain. Back in 1215, an elite caste of barons had forced\nKing John to sign Magna Carta, a deal that challenged the throne’s power in\nvarious ways, such as restraining its ability to raise taxes. They formed a\ncouncil to ensure royal compliance. 1265 saw the first elected Parliament,\nwhich eventually came to consist [not only of\nnobles](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos920287), knights and aristocrats,\nbut wealthy farmers and leaders of industry and commerce – winners of success\ngames. Following the ‘Glorious Revolution’ of 1688 a ‘bill of rights’ was\nnegotiated that established Parliament as the nation’s ruling power. No longer\ndid the crown have total control.

Legal innovations, such as secure property and patent\nrights and the principle that the law should be applied equally to all, made\nit safer for entrepreneurs to entrepreneur and their success games to form and\nflourish. Monopolies were abolished; the principle of free trade established;\nmerchants were assisted and defended with the full force of the state. It was\nin this unique environment, write the economists Professor Daron Acemoglu and\nJames A. Robinson, that innovators, ‘were able to take up the economic\nopportunities generated by their ideas, were confident that their property\nrights would be respected, and had access to markets where their innovations\ncould be profitably sold and used’.\n\nBritain had many active members in the Republic of Letters, including\narchitect Christopher Wren, philosopher Robert Boyle, economist William Petty\nand polymath Robert Hooke. Their nation increasingly took over from Italy as\nthe place in which the future was being made: [in 1675,\nit’](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos920862)s thought not a single\nhousehold in London owned porcelain dishes; by 1725, 35 per cent did. With\npower increasingly removed from the old virtue games of royalty and Church,\nBritain was a nation uniquely capable of taking the tiny knowledge-based\nsuccess game of the Republic of Letters and spreading it to the masses. Not\nonly could successful innovators win fame amongst their peers, Britain’s\ninstitutions allowed them to earn major wealth and even national celebrity,\ntheir stores of status swelling spectacularly. Increasingly, it became a game\nopen not only to an intellectual elite but to thousands of mechanics,\nentrepreneurs, engineers, tinkerers and artisans.\n\nThis ‘Industrial Revolution’ was a status goldrush. It came to define the\ncountry’s mood and culture. [Britons ‘became\ninnovators](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos921135) because they adopted\nan improving mentality’, writes historian Dr Anton Howes. This mentality\nspread like a ‘disease’ that could infect ‘anyone … rich and poor, city-\ndwellers and rustics, Anglicans and dissenters, Whigs and Tories, skilled\nengineers and complete amateurs’. A growing number ‘published about\ninnovation, lectured on it, exhibited it, and funded it’. They formed\nthemselves into communities based around their interests and established\nsocieties devoted to spreading the mindset further. These organisations were\ngenerators not only of new and useful knowledge, but major status for\nsuccessful innovators.\n\nThe revolution took off on an eruption of status games. Britain became, in the\nwords of historian Professor Peter Clark, [an ‘associational\nworld](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos921495)’. Players formed games\naround their specialisms.

They founded learned organisations dedicated to the accrual and\nspread of new and useful knowledge that, according to [economist James Dowey,\nnumbered](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos922193) less than fifty in 1750\nand around one and a half thousand by 1850.",

They founded learned organisations dedicated to the accrual and\nspread of new and useful knowledge that, according to [economist James Dowey,\nnumbered](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos922193) less than fifty in 1750\nand around one and a half thousand by 1850. One of these, [The Society for\nthe](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos922519) Encouragement of Arts,\nManufactures and Commerce, began in a London coffeehouse and awarded thousands\nof cash prizes or medals to members who solved problems or produced ingenious\ninventions, including the inventors of the lifeboat; a safer pneumatic braking\nmechanism for cranes; and a mechanical method of cleaning chimneys that made\npossible laws banning the use of boys as young as four. That association still\nexists today, better known as the Royal Society of Arts.\n\nThese associations were success games, awarding status for displays of\ncompetence. [Dowey finds](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos922759) the\nRoyal Society spent more in its first two decades on medals for inventors than\nit did on cash premiums. Its awards, he argues, had a major societal impact\nvia their effect on ambitious onlookers: as a ‘nationally visible institution\npatronised by London’s social, intellectual and commercial elites’ its most\nimportant contribution to innovation ‘was to promote and bestow prestige upon\ninventing in general’. These dynamics made status games such as the Royal\nSociety foundries of innovation. As players strived for acclaim and respect,\nthey themselves became generators of new and useful knowledge. Dowey’s\nanalyses reveal that more societies in a particular region led to more patents\nbeing awarded there; the same pattern was found in his analysis of exhibitors\nat London’s 1851 Great Exhibition: more societies in any region predicted\nhigher representation at the event, and more prizes. For every 746 society\nmembers, in any given region, its number of exhibits grew by 42 per cent, its\nprizes by 48 per cent. The relationship between learned societies and\ninnovation during the Industrial Revolution, Dowey concludes, ‘should be\ninterpreted as causal’.\n\nAnd so, out of this status goldrush, came accumulations of knowledge never\nbefore seen in human history. The atmosphere of the time was described in a\n[speech by a mathematician](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos923039), Dr\nOlinthus Gregory, delivered in 1826: ‘Agriculture, manufactures, commerce,\nnavigation, the arts and sciences, useful and ornamental, in a copious and\ninexhaustible variety, enhance the conveniences and embellishments of this\notherwise happy spot. Cities thronged with inhabitants, warehouses filled with\nstores, markets and fairs with busy rustics; fields, villages, roads,\nseaports, all contributing to the riches and glory of our land … New societies\nfor improvement … new machines to advance our arts and facilitate labour;\nwaste lands enclosed, roads improved, bridges erected, canals cut, tunnels\nexcavated, marshes drained and cultivated, docks formed, ports enlarged: these\nand a thousand kindred operations which present themselves spontaneously to\nthe mind’s eye, prove that we have not yet attained our zenith, and open an\nexquisite prospect of future stability and greatness.’\n\nThe Industrial Revolution soon spread to other parts of the world. When the\nfever for improvement caught the United States, it first rivalled and today\neasily surpasses Western Europe in its genius for innovation. Much of that\nnation’s remaining prestige is earned by its Silicon Valley technology\ncompanies. The games those innovators play were invented by scholars of the\nRepublic of Letters and given the power to transform the world by the\nrevolutions and institutions of bygone Britain.",

Much of that\nnation’s remaining prestige is earned by its Silicon Valley technology\ncompanies. The games those innovators play were invented by scholars of the\nRepublic of Letters and given the power to transform the world by the\nrevolutions and institutions of bygone Britain.\n\nThe thinkers of the Enlightenment who, in the seventeenth and eighteenth\ncenturies, further transformed Western Europe and then the world with their\nideas about reason, liberty, tolerance, and separation of Church and State,\nwere also inheritors of the games that formed before them. One of the most\nfamous, Scottish economist Adam Smith, is commonly known as the ‘Father of\nCapitalism’. Perhaps more than anyone, the hyper-individualistic, self-\ninterested money-obsessed world we live in today is linked to him and his\ntheories of how free markets and competition generate prosperity. But Smith\ndidn’t believe greed for wealth was the ultimate driver of economies. He\nthought something else was going on, something deeper in the human psyche.\n[‘Humanity does not](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos923275) desire to be\ngreat, but to be beloved,’ he wrote in 1759. ‘The rich man glories in his\nriches because he feels they naturally draw upon him the attention of the\nworld … and he is fonder of his wealth on this account than for all the other\nadvantages it procures him.’ This need for attention and approval was, for\nSmith, a fundamental part of the human condition. We strive to better our lot\nbecause we seek to be ‘observed, to be attended to, to be taken notice of’.\nIt’s the dream that says status symbols such as wealth will make us perfectly\nhappy that inspires us to ‘cultivate the ground, to build houses, to found\ncities and commonwealths, and to invent and improve all the sciences and arts,\nwhich ennoble and embellish human life; which have entirely changed the whole\nface of the globe’.\n\nWe’re immeasurably better off for our modern strivings towards excellence. [By\nthe end of](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos923671) the nineteenth\ncentury, life expectancy and living standards were rising, extreme poverty and\ninfant mortality were falling and the threat of famine and starvation that had\nforever haunted the masses was beginning to recede. Our relentless\naccumulations of useful knowledge brought astonishing innovations in\ntechnology, medicine and science. The road out of hell is mapped across the\ndata of human health and thriving. For all of history prior to the Industrial\nRevolution, global life expectancy bounced around the age of 30. It’s since\nsoared to over 70 – and, in developed nations, over 80. Scientific advances\nhave saved the lives of billions: water chlorination has saved 177 million;\nsmallpox eradication 131 million; the measles vaccine 120 million; infectious\ndisease controls have saved over a hundred million children since 1990; in\n2021 multiple coronavirus vaccines began saving the entire world. We’re also\nbetter fed than ever. In 1947, around half the planet’s population was\nundernourished; that number now stands at 13 per cent in the developing\nnations and, in the developed, less than 5 per cent. We’re also wealthier. In\n1800, nearly 95 per cent of humans lived in extreme poverty. Between 1990 and\n2018 alone that number fell from nearly 1.9 billion to about 650 million.\n\nHistory is not made by individuals, but by individuals connected into groups.\nThose groups are status games.

It emerges out of a market economy that’s heavily focussed on success.\nWhilst we’ll never stop playing games of dominance and virtue, our societies\nemphasise individual competence and achievement. We win points for personal\nsuccess throughout our lives, in the highly formalised and often precisely\ngraded games of school, college and work. In the street, in the office and on\nsocial media we signal our accomplishments with appearance, possessions and\nlifestyles. We’re self-obsessed, because [this is the game we’re\n](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos924037)raised to play.\n\nAs individualists we’ve always been relatively me-focussed. But the latter\ntwentieth century saw us transform into a heightened mode of self-obsession.\nFollowing the depression and world wars, the economies of the USA and Britain\nbecame more rule-bound, virtuous and group-focussed: it was an era of\nincreasing regulation over banking and business, high taxation ([topping out\nat 90](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos924215) per cent in America in the\n1940s and 1950s), broad unionisation and ‘big government’ innovations such as\nthe New Deal, the Social Security Act, the minimum wage and the welfare state.\nAmerican and British players became concomitantly collective: the monkey-\nsuited ‘Corporation Man’ of the 1950s suburbs gave birth to the even more\ncollectively minded hippies, with their anti-materialistic values. As ever,\nthe great game was inside us; its rules and symbols were written into our\ngame-playing equipment; we dreamed its dream and lived its iteration of self.\n\nBut in the 1980s, the game changed again. During the previous decade, the\neconomies of the West had started to fail. New ways of playing were sought.\nThe leaders of the UK and USA, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, decided to\nmake the game significantly more competitive. In 1981, Thatcher told\njournalists, [‘What’s](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos924507) irritated\nme about the whole direction of politics in the last thirty years is that it’s\nalways been toward the collectivist society.’ Thatcher and Reagan’s\ngovernments commenced a series of brutal attacks on these older, more virtue-\nbound ways of playing. They rolled back the protections of the state, cut\ntaxes, deregulated banking and business, privatised national assets, defanged\nthe unions and reined in employee rights. In this new age, wherever possible,\nthe markets, not the politicians, would be in charge. This ‘neoliberal’ game\nwas freer, less rule-bound – and more individualistic. To win, our equipment\nwould have to be re-coded yet again. To get along and get ahead, we’d have to\nbecome more competitive, more materialistic and more self-focussed.\n\nAnd so we did. It’s astonishing to think of who we were, as a people, in 1965\nversus who we’d become by 1985. In just twenty years we’d gone from fuck The\nMan to greed is good. The deeper we moved into the neoliberal age, the more we\nwere consumed by its dream. The transformation was rapid. [One study of\nover](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos924808) three hundred million births\nfound that, starting in 1983, Americans began giving their children uncommon\nand unusually spelled names.

A 2006 survey of 2,500 UK children under the\nage of 10 found their [‘very best\nthing](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos926031) in the world’ was ‘being a\ncelebrity’ (their second and third very best things in the world were ‘good\nlooks’ and ‘being rich’). In 2003, Sony launched the first phone with a front-\nfacing camera. It was [intended for use\nin](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos926341) business meetings. But that’s\nnot what we chose to do with this technology. By 2019, Google revealed users\nof Android devices alone were taking [93 million\nselfies](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos926652) every day.\n\nAs neoliberalism rose, the old games of connection and status that were once\nwidely played among friends and neighbours in their communities decayed.\nPolitical scientist Professor [Robert Putnam has\ncharted](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos926969) their collapse. ‘During\nthe first two-thirds of the century, Americans took a more and more active\nrole in the social and political life of their communities – in churches and\nunion halls, in bowling alleys and clubrooms, around committee tables and card\ntables and dinner tables,’ he writes. Such groups ‘seemed to be on the\nthreshold of a new era of expanded involvement’. But then, ‘more or less\nsimultaneously, we began to do all those things less often’.\n\nWhen discussing his play Death of a Salesman, [Arthur Miller described\nits](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos927244) tragic hero Willy Loman’s\nworldview thusly: ‘The law of success is that if you fail you’re dead.

Success cues might’ve\nstarted in ropes of teeth around a hunter’s neck, but in twenty-first-century\nWesternised cultures, they’re everywhere. Maddened by them, we sweat and spend\nand hurry to keep up. We strive to improve, to bend our personalities into a\ncertain shape, to become a better, different person. But where does it come\nfrom, the contemporary ideal of self? We see this perfect human all around us,\nbeaming with flawless teeth from advertising, film, television, media and the\ninternet. Young, agreeable, visibly fit, self-starting, productive, popular,\nglobally-minded, stylish, self-confident, extrovert, busy. Who is it, this\nperson we feel so pressured to punch ourselves into becoming? It’s the player\nbest equipped to win status in the game we’re in. It’s the neoliberal hero,\nthe fantasy of an economy. And when we don’t measure up, we read these success\nsymbols as signals of our failure. We’re individualists: believing it’s in our\nown power to win means believing that, when we don’t, it’s our fault and our\nfault alone. So we’re a loser, then: that’s who we are. We’ve been weighed on\nGod’s scale and found wanting.\n\nPsychologists have a name for people with a heightened sensitivity to signals\nof failure: perfectionist. [There are various\nforms](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos927896) of perfectionism: ‘self-\noriented perfectionists’ have excessively high standards and often push\nthemselves harder and harder in order to win; ‘narcissistic perfectionists’\nalready believe they’re number one and experience anxiety when the world\ntreats them as less; ‘neurotic perfectionists’ suffer low self-esteem and\noften believe with the next victory they’ll finally feel good enough. But\nthere’s one species of perfectionism that’s especially sensitive to the\nneoliberal game: ‘social perfectionists’ feel the pressure to win comes from\nthe people with whom they play. They’ll tend to agree with statements such as,\n‘People expect nothing less than perfection from me’ and ‘Success means that I\nmust work harder to please others.’ Social perfectionists are highly attuned\nto reputation and identity. They’ll easily think they’ve let their peers down\nby being a bad employee, a bad activist, a bad woman. An especially hazardous\nquality of social perfectionism is that it’s based on what we believe other\npeople believe. It’s in that black gap between imagination and reality that\nthe demons come.\n\nLiving the neoliberal dream, with its galaxy of signals of failure, appears to\nbe making us more perfectionistic. Further powerful evidence that altering the\nrules of our status games changes who we are can be found in [a study of\nmore](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos928104) than forty thousand students\nacross the USA, Britain and Canada.

In speculating why, the authors pointed to neoliberalism.\nThey noted the Western nations under study had ‘become more individualistic,\nmaterialistic, and socially antagonistic over this period, with young people\nnow facing more competitive environments, more unrealistic expectations, and\nmore anxious and controlling parents than generations before’. Both social\nperfectionism and materialistic goal-seeking have been linked to a witchbag of\npsychological maladies, including depression, anxiety, eating disorders and\nself-harm, rates of which have been climbing in recent years, especially in\nthe young.\n\nThere’s an injurious mismatch between the design of our brains and the vast\nand vastly unequal games that comprise neoliberal life. Status is relative:\nthe amount we feel we have depends on how much we perceive others have. Much\nof our status play happens in gargantuan corporate reinventions of tribe.\nToday, [sixty-nine of the](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos928489) hundred\nlargest economies on earth are not nations but corporations. [In the first\nquarter](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos928822) of 2021 alone, technology\ncompany Apple made more money than the annual GDP of 135 countries; its market\nvaluation was higher than the GDP of Italy, Brazil, Canada, South Korea and\nRussia. It’s all too easy, in these modern-colossal hierarchies, to feel as if\nwe’re failing, even as we provide food, shelter and security for our families\nthat’s ample. To live in the neoliberal dreamworld is to suffer some form of\nstatus anxiety. It’s standard. It’s who we are and how we play.\n\nAnd the game is getting harder. The neoliberal age has seen rewards being\ndistributed with increasing unfairness. [Between 1978 and\n2014](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos929656), inflation-adjusted CEO pay\nin the USA increased by nearly 1,000 per cent; in a similar period, [1975 to\n2017, inflation](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos929967)-adjusted US GDP\nnearly tripled and worker productivity grew by around 60 per cent. And yet,\nwhile a subset of US workers did see some increases in pay, real hourly wages\nfor most Americans froze or fell. The picture has been similar [in the\nUK](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos930249): the richest one per cent took\n7 per cent of national income in 1970; by 2005 it was 16 per cent. And yet the\nOffice of National Statistics reports wages have [‘been on\na](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos930530) broadly downwards trend’ since\nthe 1970s.\n\nAs the game has become dominated by vast corporations, the quality of the\nstatus on offer to many has diminished. This was brought home to me when I\nvisited the Welsh town of Ammanford, once a proud mining community filled with\nindependent, locally owned businesses. The mines closed in 1976 and then the\nbig supermarket came. ‘The Tesco’s killed off our local trade: the butchers,\nthe greengrocers,’ said my young interviewee, who described his generation\ngetting, ‘drawn into just going back and forth down between the shelves with\nno real end.

[Academic Professor Guy\nStanding](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos931172) argues the UK has seen\nthe emergence of a new social class, the ‘precariat’: extremely low-paid,\noften immigrant workers who survive in a series of underpaid, short-term jobs.\n‘The precariat have lives dominated by insecurity, uncertainty, debt and\nhumiliation,’ he writes. ‘They are denizens rather than citizens, losing\ncultural, civil, social, political and economic rights built up over\ngenerations.’ Much of their existence is characterised by almost total\ndeference and barely any influence, even over their own lives. Because profit-\nmaking companies fail to pay them enough to live, their wages are topped up by\nwelfare credits. This arrangement neglects to consider the overwhelming\nimportance of status. When we force hardworking people to accept handouts, we\ncommit on them an injustice: we steal from them something they’ve earned.\n\nPolitical battles between the left and right are often concerned with how\nsuccess games create and share the wealth they produce. Is it better to allow\ncreators maximal freedom to make as much cash as possible, and feed the\neconomy? Or do we tighten control, increasing their virtue element via tax and\nregulation, forcing more fairness throughout the game? These are essential\ndebates. Whilst it’s clear capitalism has an almost magical capacity to raise\nliving standards and life expectancy, it’s no less clear that leaders of\nsuccess games can be relentless and sociopathic in their desire to win.\n\nFollowing the pressure of 2008’s global financial crisis, psychologists\nsurveying college students found [evidence of a\ntightening](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos931435). As the perception\nspread that the neoliberal game was broken, and its expected rewards were no\nlonger paying out, markers for individualism and narcissism among the students\ndeclined. The same period saw the emergence of what looks like a Social Media\nSelf. Cadres of people who’d been partly socialised online, using the rules\nand symbols of websites such as Twitter, Tumblr and Reddit, brought these\nplatforms’ harsh, virtue-bound and identity-fluid modes of play into the\noffline world. Rebellious and furious, their games have now become something\nof a status goldrush for young and privileged players. The coming years might\nsee them undergo a significant expansion. Many of the battles they fight\ncentre on the failures of neoliberalism, and the fact that we still struggle\nto offer equal opportunities to play across categories of race and gender.\n\n\n[26](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos6335)\n\n[Fairness, Unfairness](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos6335)\n\nIN THESE EARLY decades of the twenty-first century, we’re still riding the\nblast of cultural innovations triggered in the sixteenth.

As the\nIndustrial Revolution spread, and these games won increasing influence over\nculture, the worth and wellbeing of the individual player took on a more\ncentral importance. In Britain, 1859 saw the publication of Self-Help by\nSamuel Smiles, the first book of its kind. Filled with inspiring case studies,\nit argued even players at the bottom of the game could move up with hard work\nand perseverance. Smiles began with a quote from philosopher John Stuart Mill:\n‘The worth of a State, in the long run, is the worth of the individuals\ncomposing it.’ It was an instant bestseller.\n\nWhere once we belonged to our tribe, we began to belong to ourselves. Every\nhuman was precious; individuals had rights. The rule that grew out of this –\nthat the great game should be played without boundaries of class, race, gender\nor sexuality – is radical and new. Its struggles still possess the everyday\nlives of millions, their tales of injustice often dominating the modern gossip\nnetworks of traditional and social media. In the anxious fury of all this,\nit’s easy to lose sight of the extent to which our basic ideas of fairness\nhave been revised. The Enlightenment thinker David Hume was a critic of\nslavery, but nevertheless wrote in 1754 that [he was\n‘apt](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos932008) to suspect the Negroes and\nin general all other species of men (for there are four or five different\nkinds) to be naturally inferior to the whites’. In 1879, the pioneering and\ninfluential social psychologist [Gustave Le Bon\nwrote](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos932265), ‘there are a large number\nof women whose brains are closer in size to those of gorillas than to the most\ndeveloped male brain … Without doubt there exist some distinguished women,\nvery superior to the average man, but they are as exceptional as the birth of\nany monstrosity, as, for example, of a gorilla with two heads.’\n\nToday these views are more than outrageous, they’re taboo. Even extremists who\ncling to them understand that publicly voicing these beliefs in the West is to\ncontravene sacred rules and so to risk prosecution, expulsion from employment,\npublic shaming and perhaps physical attack. But, only recently, deeply\nprejudicial concepts like these were mainstream and accepted by many of the\nworld’s smartest thinkers. When seeking to explain the game of life, the brain\ntells a simplistic and often self-serving story about why things are the way\nthey are. [Intellectuals such as\nHume](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos932545) and Le Bon experienced a\nreality in which there was a reliable ranking of gender and race. They wove a\nstatus-making dream around that hierarchy that told of white male superiority.\nThey couldn’t know, as we know now, that Western European culture was not a\nproduct of innate superiority or even deliberate planning, but luck, accident\nand unintended consequence; they hadn’t yet realised the global oppression of\nwomen was not an inevitable pattern of nature but an epic historical\ninjustice.\n\nBut the rule tweaks that created Western success game culture were soon to\ntransform our conception of each other and what we considered fair play.\nTowards the end of the eighteenth century, discussion of ‘human rights’ became\nmore common in the West, with [published use of\nthe](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos933010) word ‘rights’ quadrupling\nbetween the 1780s and 1790s.

[Public executions in\nthe](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos933555) UK had once drawn huge and\nraucous crowds, with contemporary reports at London hangings telling of the\n‘most amazing scenes of drunkenness and debauchery’ and a ‘remorseless\nmultitude … shouting, laughing, throwing snowballs at each other’. [In 1868\nParliament abolished](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos933841) them. It\nwasn’t even eighty years earlier that they’d banned burning women at the\nstake.\n\nFor historian Professor Lynn Hunt, such shifts were inspired by profound\nchanges in how we viewed the individual player: ‘Since pain and the body\nitself now belonged only to the individual, rather than the community, the\nindividual could no longer be sacrificed to the good of the community, or to a\nhigher religious purpose.’ Cruel practices such as torture and public\nexecution began to end because ‘[the traditional framework of\npain](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos934132) and personhood fell apart,\nto be replaced, bit by bit, by a new framework in which individuals owned\ntheir bodies, had rights to their separateness and to bodily inviolability,\nand recognised in other people the same passions, sentiments and sympathies as\nthemselves’.\n\nThe principle of equal rights spread to religious and racial minorities and\nwomen. Slavery, which has existed across the world since the first\ncivilisations, finally began to end: Denmark banned participation in the slave\ntrade in 1804, Britain voted to end participation in 1807, abolishing it in\nmost colonies in 1834. In the USA, Congress passed the thirteenth amendment,\nabolishing slavery, on 6 December 1865. In 1918, the UK’s Representation of\nthe People Act extended the vote to unpropertied men and some propertied\nwomen. It passed [by a majority\nof](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos934419) 385 to 55. Women won equal\nvoting rights ten years later. In the US, full suffrage was won in 1920 (it\ntook the Swiss until 1971). Capital punishment, which is thought to have once\nbeen a human universal, was increasingly outlawed. In the seventeenth century,\nresidents of New Haven in America could be [put to death\nfor](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos934802) masturbating; [until 1834\nBritain was](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos935065) still gibbeting the\ncorpses of murderers. By 2020, over half the world’s nations had formally\nabolished it. Most recently, the principle of equality has been extended to\nsexual minorities. At the time of writing, same-sex marriage has been\nlegalised in twenty-eight nations, almost all of them Western in culture.\n\nBut this process is still in play. The focus on competence over caste-\nidentities such as race, gender and sexuality is a recent development.\nBillions of people still play these games, drawing significant amounts of\nstatus from the colour of their skin, their country of birth or whether they\nhave XX or XY chromosomes.

As we’ve learned, we still operate basic\ncoding that, when seeking others with which to play games, uses ‘self-\nsimilarity’ as a cue. We’re drawn to our own.\n\nThe research literature on racial injustice groans with shame. [One major\ninvestigation of](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos935342) more than\n200,000 job applications in nine Western nations examined how racial identity\ninfluenced the likelihood of any applicant receiving a callback. It found\nevidence of ‘pervasive hiring discrimination against all non-white groups’ in\nevery country, with France and Sweden showing the gravest problems: in those\nnations, members of minority groups would have to send between 70 and 94 per\ncent more applications than whites to receive the same number of callbacks.\nBritain was third on the list, at 55 per cent.\n\nBut there were some encouraging glimmers. Despite its well-known problems with\nrace, the USA was third from bottom. The researchers thought this was because\nmajor US companies have to report the racial make-up of each rank of their\nbusiness to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a mode of monitoring\nthat doesn’t happen in the European nations. Even more encouraging news came\nfrom Germany, a nation whose reputation for racism was once pre-eminent. Of\nthe nine nations studied, they were the most equitable. [Sociologist Professor\nLincoln Quillian](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos935896) argued one\nreason for its ‘low discrimination’ is that a variety of supporting documents,\nsuch as apprenticeship reports, have to be submitted with job applications.\n‘Having a lot of information at first application reduces the tendency to view\nminority applicants as less good or unqualified,’ he has said. The more an\nemployer knows about a candidate’s competence, the weaker their prejudice\nseems to become.\n\nOther studies support this. In one, the initial racial biases of group members\nwere overcome by experimenters [introducing ‘additional\nlegitimate](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos936217) and unambiguous status\ninformation that is directly relevant to the group task and that advantages\nthe actor over the others present’. [A similar effect\nwas](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos936516) found in a study in which\nwhite players who’d been sorted into [a team with black players\nexpressed](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos936992) a bias in favour of\ntheir team that ‘outweighed their initial racial bias’. Such research offers\nhope. Humans aren’t programmed to be racist but to be biased towards their\ngroups. If we plug our desire for status too strongly into our racial\nidentity, we’ll end up playing racial games. But we don’t have to do this.\nHumans want to win. They want their games to win. If their need for status is\nplugged into a success game, they’re often more interested in a player’s\ncompetence than the colour of their skin.\n\nFuture generations will also continue the struggle for gender equality. Sexist\nassumptions remain widespread. [One survey\nacross](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos937253) the G7 nations of Canada,\nFrance, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the USA found around 80 per cent of\nrespondents believing men and women were equally suited to leadership in\nmedia, science, medicine, law, politics and finance.

In sports, technology,\naerospace and engineering, it was between 65 and 75 per cent. For defence and\npolice, fashion and beauty and childcare, only about half thought there was no\ngender difference in leadership ability. Presumably, many respondents noted\nhigher male presence in engineering, say, and higher female presence in\nchildcare, and concluded one gender was better at these occupations. This is\nproving a frustratingly stubborn lesson to learn: underestimating a player on\nthe basis of their gender is not only ignorant, it’s a terrible strategy for\nsuccess.\n\nThe truth, of course, is that men and women are equally suited to leadership\nin all these professions. But the reasons some become more populated by one\ngender or another are in dispute. Many researchers suspect generalised\nvariations between the sexes is part of the answer. Almost nobody believes,\nthese days, that male and female psychology is categorically dissimilar: we’re\nnot from Mars and Venus; furthermore, it’s now understood men and women are\nfar more alike than different. But studies suggest the sexes do, on average,\nshow differences in personality, interest and vocational preference that\naffect their distribution in the games of life. [One study, taking\nin](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos937667) 200,000 respondents across 53\ncountries, found women differed significantly in some personality traits and\nfound a ‘large and consistent sex difference’ in preference for occupation. A\ncommonly noted finding says men tend to be more interested in working with\n‘things’ whilst women tend to be more interested in working with people. An\nanalysis of more than half a million individuals found a ‘large effect size’\non this dimension that was ‘remarkably consistent across age and over time’.\nAccording to psychologist Professor [Steven Pinker,\n‘there’s](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos938185) an enormous average\ndifference between women and men in this dimension’.\n\nSuch variations can’t help but reflect in the gender-balance of our games. But\nthere are two crucially important things to note about them. Firstly, these\nare average statistics across large groups of people. They say nothing about\nany individual woman or man. Secondly, preference is not ability. As the\nleadership survey suggests, a common sexist interpretation has it that men are\nbetter at some things and women are better at others. This is not correct.\nRather, it is about the weight of numbers. If you were to gather one hundred\nmen and women and ask those who were interested in tractors to step forwards,\nmore men than women might take that step. The real-world ramification would be\nmore men working in a tractor factory and more male leaders in that industry.\nWhat it wouldn’t mean is that women working at the tractor factory would be\nany better or worse at their jobs than men.\n\nFeminist scholars often deny the validity of these kinds of findings. They\nsniff in them an all-too-convenient excuse for maintaining the status quo.\nThey also debate their cause. Is it purely cultural coding? That is, are women\nraised in sexist environments and programmed to believe they’re not supposed\nto be interested in tractors? Or is this coding sufficiently ancient that it’s\nwritten into the hardware of our DNA? Are women more interested in games\nrelating to people, partly because of division of labour going back millions\nof years and the biological fact of motherhood? Needless to say, such\narguments are controversial. Because they connect directly to matters of\nstatus, they’re fraught and can be dangerous to have.",

But there are reasonable and well-meaning\nexperts in both camps, each with considered sets of evidence.

If it turns out the causes are partly genetic, the fight will\nbe on to somehow arrange society and economy such that millions of women are\nno longer unfairly penalised for expressing who they are.\n\nGender and race aren’t the only injustices built into the games we play today.\nFive hundred generations after the dawn of agriculture, we’re still born into\na social caste that helps direct our position in the hierarchy and future\nprofession. Class is stubborn because, as Professor Kusserow found in her\nstudy of parenting in Manhattan’s Upper East Side, children raised in these\ngames have elite rules and symbols written into their brains from birth.\nSocial class isn’t simply about wealth and ancestry, it’s about taste in the\narts, food, sports, holidays and clothing. It’s in a person’s accent and the\nwords they use. [Nancy Mitford, the\naristocratic](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos938709) daughter of the 2nd\nBaron Redesdale, caused a minor sensation in 1955 with her essay exploring the\n‘Upper Class English Usage’ of language. Mitford listed ‘U’ (‘upper class’)\nversus ‘non-U’ words: ‘Sweet: non-U for U pudding’; ‘Toilet paper: non-U for U\nlavatory paper’; ‘U-speakers eat luncheon in the middle of the day and dinner\nin the evening; Non-U-speakers (also U-children and U-dogs) have their dinner\nin the middle of the day’. Mitford also documented the U use of the scolding,\njudgy silence: ‘silence is the only possible U-response to many embarrassing\nmodern situations: the ejaculation of “cheers” before drinking, for example,\nor “it was so nice seeing you,” after saying goodbye. In silence, too, one\nmust endure the use of the Christian name by comparative strangers and the\nhorror of being introduced by Christian and surname without any prefix.’\n\nToday, the elite school at [Eton provides a\nglossary](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos939063) as part of its ‘New Boy\nGuide’, so arriving scholars can learn an esoteric language no less bizarre\nthan that spoken by the members of Heaven’s Gate: ‘Beak, a master, i.e.\nteacher’; ‘Dry Bobs, cricketers’; ‘Oppidan, any boy who is not a Colleger’;\n‘Porny School, a primary school in Eton High Street’; ‘The Wall, the wall\nagainst which the wall game is played.’ It’s not uncommon for elite\neducational institutions to have their own esoteric language.

This might sound reprehensible,\nbut all status games behave this way. Knowing the meaning of ‘oppidan’ and\n‘dry bobs’ and to use the ‘lavatory’ not the ‘toilet’ is to know that\ncomparing India to Mars is racist and colonialist and that you should never\nglance at another man’s yam pit.

One\ninterviewee, Louise, was raised on a south London council estate and couldn’t\nread or write at age 14. And yet, as an adult, she sat on the boards of\nseveral major beauty brands, earning over a quarter of a million pounds a\nyear. Louise played daily with people raised in elite families. She said these\npeople respected her background and journey. And yet she reported a ‘strong\nsense of isolation’ that felt rooted in a ‘culture of informal chatting in the\nworkplace, where talking about the arts, sharing anecdotes about holidays or\ndiscussing children’s schooling can be an important way of oiling the wheels\nof business relationships or building rapport with senior colleagues’. Louise\ntold the researchers, ‘I don’t really participate, you know, I’m very\ndistant.’\n\nSimilar experiences of alienation can be felt by those moving sideways between\ngames at the cultural level: often immigrants raised with one set of rules and\nsymbols only to live an adult life immersed in others.

The\nresearchers describe her negotiating ‘an exhausting balancing act between the\ncultural values of her working-class, ethnic and middle-class occupational\nidentities’. Gita told them, ‘I’ve always thought I’ve never really belonged,\nbut then I always thought it was just me, y’know? Because I felt I didn’t\nbelieve totally in the Indian culture, but I didn’t belong in my English\nfriends’ lives because they were a lot more free. So I’ve always drifted,\ndipped in and out of different cultures, always been quite a detached person\nwherever I go.’\n\nThat distance, that detachment, that alienation: Louise and Gita might well\nsuspect it could hold them back in their status play. Success can just be\neasier for those raised in an elite class or even a nation’s most populous\nculture. This doesn’t mean those they encountered were operating with malice.\nThey were simply playing by the rules and symbols that had been built into\ntheir brains, being human in the only way they knew. But it’s equally true\nthese players entered the games of life with a head-start – with privilege.\n\nPrivilege is an explosive notion. As we’ve learned, humans are designed to be\nmaddened by others they experience as prancing about above them, their status\nunfair and on display. Resentment pricks us into desiring to pull them down,\nwhether by social distancing, mockery, humiliation, ostracization or\nexecution. Such resentments have helped power some of the most lethal events\nin human history. The Nazis and the Communists aimed their hatred at groups\nthey perceived as having status that was unearned. They told a story in which\ngroups had grabbed wealth, influence and power that wasn’t their due, and that\nwrenching them from their privileged heights by hunting and murdering them was\nfair play.\n\nThe danger is in the dream. Those above us might’ve climbed up there through\nsweat and ability; they might’ve schemed and dominated. Most likely, they’ll\nhave used all available strategies. Whatever the truth, we’re vulnerable to\nbelieving simplistic brain-spun tales that say they’ve simply cheated and\ntheir visible thriving is cheating us.",

None of\nwhich is to argue racism isn’t real, serious and deserving of urgent\nattention. It’s simply to observe the world is often more confusing than the\nwarriors allow.\n\nThere are any number of ways to have privilege in the game of life. You can\nbe: smart; attractive; mentally healthy; talented; able-bodied; male in a\nmale-dominated game; female in a female-dominated game; under the age of 30;\nprivately schooled; university educated; not born into poverty; professionally\nconnected; have the right kind of accent; live in the right part of the\ncountry; have successful, kind or connected parents; live in a Westernised\nculture with its freedoms, opportunities and concern with equality and human\nrights, and so on. The truth about privilege is that it’s a combination of all\nthese factors and more: it’s complex, dynamic and unique to who we are and\nwhat games we’re trying to play.\n\nA major form of privilege is genetic. It takes a certain kind of personality\nto thrive and much of our temperament, grit, intelligence, sociability and\nrelative desire for status is hereditary, born into us – and then bred into us\nfurther, if we’re lucky enough to have that kind of parenting.

It’s being fought by\nrival coalitions who each inhabit a different dream of reality. Both believe\nthe game of life to be fixed. One side perceives it to be unfairly dominated\nby white people, especially white men, especially straight white men. The\nother side thinks it’s unfairly dominated by highly educated elites. In recent\nyears, they’ve been making major incursions into the hierarchies of society.\nOne side has won a series of impressive victories, colonising the games of\nculture, education and commerce. The other has won major victories in the\npolitical game, most notably in 2016, in the election of Donald Trump to the\nUS Presidency and the vote for the UK to leave the European Union. Their\nbattle marks what could be the beginning of the end of the neoliberal era as\nwe know it.\n\nThese armies are known by a variety of insulting, unwieldy or inaccurate\nnames: the wokes, SJWs or Progressive Activists on one side; on the other, the\nalt-right, white supremacists or National Populists. For the sake of brevity\nand fairness, we’ll call them the New Left and the New Right. Both play virtue\ngames. They seek moral status from their co-players by battling for their\nsacred symbols, including beliefs. They play tight and use dominance\nstrategies, attacking online and in the streets, in violent protests, in the\nvandalization of the sacred symbols of their opponents and in shows of\nintimidation and force by groups such as Antifa on the left and The Proud Boys\non the right. Each group is swept up by their own simplistic, self-serving\nstory: they’re moral heroes, punching upwards at the evil forces of injustice.\nThis is a war of the fringes. Most of the population don’t precisely share\ntheir perception of the game and how it operates. The trouble is, the New Left\nand New Right tend to see everyone who’s not for them as the enemy. And so the\npolitical centre, where the majority live, finds itself under attack from both\nsides, leaving many feeling alienated, baffled, angry and afraid as the world\nchurns around them.\n\nViewed from the perspective of the status game, the hidden forces that power\nthe culture war begin to suggest themselves. We’ve already learned that,\nthroughout history, societies have come under stress when the expected rewards\nof their games have failed to pay out. This has been the case for many on the\nNew Left.

Something like\nthis appears to be happening to many in the New Left. They’re the elite caste\nof the seven national groups, coming [from the wealthiest\nhouseholds](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos944822) and being the most\nhighly educated. More on the New Left possess graduate degrees and higher\ndegrees, such as PhDs or MScs, than any other. [In 2019, 31\nper](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos945182) cent of UK graduates were\nworking in positions for which they were overqualified. In 1992 that figure\nwas 22 per cent. [A 2020 survey\nof](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos945435) 215,000 recent graduates found\nthey were more anxious than the general population. In the USA, where an\nextraordinary [13 per cent of](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos945687)\nadults have a PhD, MSc or professional degree (a number that’s doubled since\n2000), [34 per cent of](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos945954) college\ngraduates are underemployed, and 41 per cent of recent graduates. Whilst new\nroles are being created in expanding industries such as IT, other games are\nbeing disproportionately hit. In both nations, [graduates in the\narts](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos946294), humanities and media are\namong the most underemployed of all.\n\nThis decline in relative status for young, internet socialised, highly\neducated players is turning into a growing rejection of the game. In just\nthree years, [between 2015 and\n2018](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos946862), support for capitalism\namong young Americans fell from 39 per cent to 30 per cent; a 2019 poll found\n36 per cent of millennials saying they [approve of\nCommunism](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos947169).

This category doesn’t include all Trump\nand Brexit voters, who number in the tens of millions and include ethnic\nminorities. Our focus is on the white base, the working and lower-middle\nclasses without college degrees, whose relative status has been in decline in\nthe neoliberal era. [Between 1979 and\n2005](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos948371), the average real hourly\nwage for white working-class Americans without a high-school diploma declined\nby 18 per cent. Political scientist Professor [Katherine Cramer\ndescribes](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos948723) the perception they’re\nworking as hard as their parents, yet are being rewarded with a poorer quality\nof life. ‘They feel like they’re doing what they were told they needed to do\nto get ahead. And somehow it’s not enough.’ Similar attitudes have been found\namongst white working-class Tea Party supporters in Louisiana. Sociologist\nProfessor Cecilia Ridgeway writes of research suggesting they [‘grew up\nseeing](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos949033) themselves at the\nrespected centre of America with the status of hardworking, traditional,\nmiddle Americans’ but now feel undermined socially and economically and\n‘treated with contempt by coastal Americans and urban elites who looked down\non them as ignorant, prejudiced hicks and who gave special privileges to other\nsocial groups who, they felt, hadn’t worked as hard as they had’. These\nresentments easily curdle into racism: these ‘other social groups’ who they\nsee as benefitting from ‘special privileges’ include African Americans.\n\nThe story told by this cohort of whites says that highly educated elites hold\nall the power and insult and de-grade them as ‘trailer-trash’ and\n‘deplorables’, whilst unfairly boosting the rank of minorities. Their\nequivalents in the UK tell the same tale. There, these minorities are more\nlikely to be immigrants. In both nations, educated elites have spent decades\npromoting the neoliberal project of globalisation, which seeks to turn as much\nof the world as possible into an open market around which goods, services and\nlabour can freely flow. The white working-class communities of Britain have\nbeen significantly impacted by incoming populations of black, eastern European\nand Muslim workers. The economic transformation wrought by this neoliberalist\nplan has [‘fuelled a strong](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos949312) sense\nof relative deprivation – a belief among certain groups that they are losing\nout relative to others’, write Professors of Politics Roger Eatwell and\nMatthew Goodwin, authors of an extensive analysis of the rise of National\nPopulism. ‘This means they are very fearful about the future and what lies\nahead for themselves and their children. This profound sense of loss is\nintimately entwined with the way in which people think through issues like\nimmigration and identity. Today there are millions of voters who are convinced\nthat the past was better than the present and that the present, however bleak,\nis still better than the future.’\n\nThe political positions of the New Right are held in abhorrence by many across\nthe left, and some on the centre-right. They’re pro-nation state, anti-\nglobalisation, anti-immigration, anti-[‘hyper ethnic\nchange](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos949606)’.

These\nare people who have borne the full force of the economic winds – the decline\nof secure, permanent and well-paid jobs, and a knowledge economy that puts a\npremium on the college degrees they do not have.’ These were the concerns that\n2016’s Brexit and Trump campaigns so successfully connected with. They’re on\nthe rise, too, across Europe, embodied in figures such as Marine Le Pen in\nFrance, Matteo Salvini in Italy and Viktor Orbán in Hungary.\n\nThe clashing dreams of the New Right and New Left are neatly illustrated in [a\nsequence of tweets](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos950750) by a US\njournalist, Rani Molla. Linking to a report on the plight of poor white\nworkers in a rural chicken processing plant earning as little as thirteen\ndollars an hour, she commented: ‘oh shut the fuck up … alt title: “How does it\nfeel to have every advantage and still be a whiny asshole?”’ [Molla has\nwritten for](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos951389) the Wall Street\nJournal, Bloomberg and Vox and has degrees from Oberlin College and the\nColumbia Journalism School, both elite institutions. Molla and the New Left\nsee the game as fixed one way: biological categories such as whiteness supply\nplayers with ‘every advantage’. But their opposites see the game as fixed in\nanother way: Molla’s elite education has given her and those like her ‘every\nadvantage’. [When the New Right](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos951733)\nlook upwards, ‘they often see people who have had a completely different\nupbringing, lead fundamentally different lives and hold very different\nvalues’, write Eatwell and Goodwin. ‘Education lies at the heart of this\ndivide.’ Most of the [41 per cent\nof](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos952004) white millennials who voted\nfor Trump in 2016 didn’t have college degrees.

Whilst the civilising mission of the New Left demonises\nwhite people (especially white men etc.), the New Right demonise ethnic\nminorities they see as being gifted unfair rank by the educated elites. Justin\nGest, Associate Professor of Policy and Government, found this in two white\nworking-class neighbourhoods, Youngstown in Ohio and Dagenham in east London.\n[In both places, the](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos959535) white\nworking class felt outnumbered by minority groups, excluded from the political\nprocess and subject to racial prejudice. [‘Many white\nworking](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos959911)-class individuals view\nthe struggle for equal treatment as a personal loss of status – a campaign to\ndemote white people, rather than to promote others.’\n\nOver the last century, Youngstown has declined from its self-proclaimed\nposition of ‘steel capital of the world’ to producing an [average income of\njust](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos960268) $14,996.\n[‘It’s](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos960524) the American Nightmare,’\none man told Gest. ‘The way I see it, you don’t have a fucking shot.’ [When\nGest asked members](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos960786) of the white\nworking class who looked out for their interests, typical answers included,\n‘nobody’, ‘you and me’ and most commonly ‘I look out for myself.’ Racial\nresentments were common, often resolving around the story that African\nAmericans were both looked after and worried over in ways that they weren’t.\n[A mother of two](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos961098) told Gest,\n‘Everyone acts like the white people are well off. You’re white, so you must\nbe rich. We work two jobs and struggle to get our kids through school. But\nyou’re white, you can afford it. You don’t need help, no minority loan, no\ngovernment discount.’ She pointed to a house next door. ‘There are gang\nmembers in that home … they are running down our neighbourhoods. That’s why we\nare getting the hell out … You do not touch, talk to, or threaten a black\nchild. They can say or do whatever they want to a white child though.’ Another\ncomplained, in apparently coded language, about people [‘driving around\nin](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos961350) new cars and I can’t even\nafford a vehicle. The government pays their rent and utilities, and so they\nspend the cash on gold chains and a Cadillac, when I can barely afford a\nCavalier.’\n\nSuch codes weren’t in evidence in Dagenham.

A 22-year-old woman told Gest,\n[‘If there’](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos962233)s a job interview and\nan immigrant doesn’t get it, they’ll say the employer is racist. I feel like\nthey’re taking our jobs, homes, and everything that the government is trying\nto do for English people, they’re getting it first.’ An 18-year-old man said\nthat Asians ‘walk around like they’re higher than us, when we were the ones\nwho welcomed them into our country. Everyone is really annoyed with it. I feel\nlike I’m on the outside looking inside to the immigrants.’\n\nAlso common was the ‘I’m not racist, but …’ conversational tic. For Gest, this\nwasn’t a sincere request to be considered not bigoted, but an appeal to be\nheard: the word racist is [‘a mute\nbutton](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos962494) pressed on someone while\nthey are still crying out about a sense of loss’. [Across forty interviews,\nGest](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos962747) heard the ‘I’m not racist,\nbut …’ appeal an extraordinary thirty-two times. Here’s a small selection:\n‘I’m not racist, but this used to be a nice community of English people,\nbefore all the Albanians and Africans came over’; ‘I’m not a racist. I fucking\nlove goat’s curry, pardon my language. But the principle of English families\nnot coming first is just not right’; ‘I’m not racist at all … but the Polish\nhave been taking all of the work and running prostitution and drug rings’;\n‘I’m not racist but this country’s covered by blacks and Bosnians.’\n\nThe white working-class residents of Dagenham live inside this toxic dream\nbecause they play games with the symbols of race and nationhood. The projects\nof neoliberalism and globalisation have de-ranked their games and covered\ntheir physical and neural territories with symbols of defeat. It doesn’t\nmatter to them that immigration is a win for the British economy; neither do\nthey have a visceral experience of the automation and outsourcing that’s also\nbeen responsible for their decline. All they see is their decline.

Our\nnight-time visions are not completely fantastic: we are who we are and meet\npeople we know in places we recognise, but these simulations of reality are\nintercut with delusion.

The New Right says the\neducated elites have stopped caring about them entirely. It sees their\ncontempt for the white and in pain and their veneration of minorities. These\nare errors of exaggeration: not all white people are bigots just as not all\nthe educated elites are prejudiced against the white working class. But they\nalso mislead by omission. They fail to see that, in each clashing dream,\nthere’s both hatred and truth.\n\n\n[28](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos6528)\n\n[The Parable of the Communists ](../Text/index_split_004.html#filepos6528)\n\nWHAT IF IT was possible to live without status? To create a society in which\nthe requirement for getting ahead was eradicated, and getting along was all\nthat mattered? The misery and injustice the status game creates, the envy and\nthe fury and the sheer bloody exhaustion of it – all gone. Imagine! It would\nbe a utopia, the coming of a true paradise on earth, the final, beautiful\nchapter in the story of human progress. But how would you go about it? Where\nwould you start? Well, what creates these divisions between us in the first\nplace? What makes inequality? Wealth. Private ownership – of property, of\ngoods, of land, of businesses and industries, of everything. So that’s where\nwe’ll start. No more private ownership. Everything must be shared. We’ll live\nand work communally. If we all strive on behalf of one another, instead of\nourselves, we’ll create an incredible bounty that can be given out according\nto need rather than greed. We’ll call it ‘Communism’.\n\n[This notion is thought](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos963649) to have\nits roots in Ancient Greece: as the first place in which private land was\ncommodified, it was also the first to see the inequalities such a system could\nbring. [Plato argued for an](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos963929) ideal\nstate in which everything, including wives and children, were shared, and ‘the\nprivate and individual is altogether banished from life, and things which are\nby nature private, such as eyes and ears and hands, have become common’.

But now a new class – industrialists,\ncapitalists, the ‘bourgeoisie’ – were becoming conspicuously wealthy, often on\nthe back of herds of mistreated and humiliated workers. Anger began to swell,\nnot only in pockets of the working class, but among intellectuals who\n[resented the rise in](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos964755) status of\nthese nouveaux riches. Among these thinkers were Karl Marx and Friedrich\nEngels who wrote, in 1848’s Communist Manifesto: ‘the theory of the Communists\nmay be summed up in a single sentence: Abolition of private property.’\n\nUnder Communism, they believed, the division of labour that marked the birth\nof tens of thousands of years of inequality, would end. Humans wouldn’t be\ndevoted to a single game of competence at which they’d specialise: instead\nthey’d dance about from one task to another. In a Communist world, wrote Marx,\n[‘society regulates the](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos965030) general\nproduction and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another\ntomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the\nevening, criticise after dinner … without ever becoming hunter, fisherman,\nherdsman or critic’.\n\nThe dream woven by the Communists told of a rebirth of the human animal.\nCapitalist systems had [forced people away\nfrom](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos965299) their natural state of\ncooperation and into one of competition, a harsh world where love and sharing\nhad been monsterised into one of cost, benefit and trade in which a human\nbeing was of value only to the extent they could help another get ahead. This\npursuit of status, that had been conjured by the greedy, capitalist\n‘bourgeoisie’, had poisoned our very perceptions. [‘A house\nmay](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos965572) be large or small; as long as\nthe surrounding houses are equally small it satisfies all social demands for a\ndwelling,’ wrote Marx. ‘But let a palace arise beside the little house, and it\nshrinks from a little house to a hut.’ Even if that little house grows and\ngrows, ‘if the neighbouring palace grows to an equal or even greater extent,\nthe occupant of the relatively small house will feel more and more\nuncomfortable, dissatisfied and cramped within its four walls’.\n\nThis bourgeois elite, the story said, were only able to fund their palaces and\nmaintain their place at the top by private ownership of industry. They abused\nthe power it gave them in order to exploit everyone else. [It was ownership\nthat](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos965822) created social classes,\nownership that led to the ‘pauperization’ of the poor and ownership that\n‘grows the mass of misery, oppression, slavery, degradation, exploitation’. If\na paradise of equality was to be achieved, their ownership of the means of\nproduction would have to end. And this would happen. Of that there was no\ndoubt. Because the system was untenable: the capitalist bourgeoisie would eat\neach other, diminishing in number as a result of sheer competition, whilst the\nangry and exploited propertyless workers, or ‘proletarians’, would keep\nincreasing. Revolution, all across the industrial world, was inevitable. ‘Let\nthe ruling classes tremble at a Communist revolution,’ they wrote. ‘The\nproletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.’\n\nAnd, when they did, our species would arrive at a promised land, reborn into a\nlevel of transcendental status akin to that imagined by the Nazis and the\nHeaven’s Gate cultists.",

And beyond this ridge, other peaks will\nemerge.’\n\nThe person most credited with attempting to realize this dream is Vladimir\nIlyich Ulyanov, better known as Lenin. His hatred for the bourgeoisie was\nblinding, violent and total; [many contemporary historians\nsee](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos966409) its genesis in the\nhumiliation his own upper-middle class family suffered after his brother,\nSasha, was executed for a [‘laughably\namateur’](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos966675) but nearly successful\nassassination plot. Lenin’s parents had been socially ambitious and remarkably\nsuccessful in gaining status. Born to a tailor in 1870, his father had risen\nto the rank of a member of the nobility and won the prestigious award of the\nOrder of Saint Vladimir, 3rd Class. But the family’s arrival in these rarefied\nplanes wasn’t as sure as it should’ve been. Writes historian Professor Robert\nService, [‘the mass of](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos966955) Simbirsk\nprovince’s noblemen had enjoyed this status for several generations’. As a\nnewcomer, Lenin’s father was often treated by the city’s elites with snobbish\ndisdain.\n\nFollowing Sasha’s arrest and execution, the proud family were tossed back to\nthe ‘margins of society’. [Dignitaries\nwho’d](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos967246) once been guests stopped\nvisiting; old friends never called; strangers stared at them in the streets.\n‘[Respectable Simbirsk](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos967534) – its\ndoctors, teachers, administrators and army officers – indicated its\nabhorrence’ for them.

[After\nseizing power violently](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos969469) in a coup\nd’état, the Bolsheviks found themselves not only lacking majority support in\nthe nation, but were surrounded by rival factions of socialists and\nanarchists. Here was a grandiose man driven by the wounds of humiliation; he\nwas leading a high-status group conspicuous for its use of intense dominance-\nvirtue play that was paranoiacally insecure about its position, and surrounded\nby high-status foes both real and imagined. By the logic of the status game,\nthis was a situation immaculately designed to generate hell.\n\nBefore the new classless utopia could emerge, Marx argued there would be a\nnecessary but temporary transitional state in which dominance would be used to\nrearrange society and wrest ownership from the claws of the capitalists. This\nwould be [the ‘dictatorship of](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos969812)\nthe proletariat’. And so Lenin authorised his leaders to begin [‘the looting\nof](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos970075) the looters’: the taking of\ncash, goods and property from the bourgeoisie, who were humiliated by being\nforced to carry out menial public works such as snow clearing and street\ncleaning. As one leading revolutionary put it: [‘for centuries\nour](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos970447) fathers and grandfathers have\nbeen cleaning up the dirt and filth of the ruling classes, but now we will\nmake them clean up our dirt’. [They were classed\nas](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos970789) ‘former people’ and ‘struggled\nto survive’, writes historian Professor Orlando Figes. ‘They were forced to\nsell their last possessions just to feed themselves.

When not enough was found, Lenin dreamed\ninto being a flock of scheming witches: relatively wealthy and successful\npeasants – kulaks – who he accused of being capitalists and hoarding their\ngrain. ‘[The kulaks are the rabid\nfoes](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos972355) of the Soviet government,’\nhe wrote. ‘These bloodsuckers have grown rich on the hunger of the people.\nThese spiders have grown fat out of the workers.

The Communists\n[‘favored policies that](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos973115) strongly\ndiscriminated against “former people,” members of the old privileged classes,\nand in favor of workers, the new “dictator class”,’ writes historian Professor\nSheila Fitzpatrick. One way this new status hierarchy began to emerge\nmanifested in food rations. Red Army soldiers and bureaucrats were at the top\nand ate the most; then came workers and then, finally, the hated bourgeoisie\nwho were given, in the words of one senior revolutionary, [‘just enough\nbread](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos973407) so as not to forget the\nsmell of it’.

Their leaders told an irresistible story in which the USSR would\nrise from being considered a backward society, far behind the West, to being\nthe most advanced in the world. Writes Professor of Political Science, Leslie\nHolmes, [‘There can be](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos974115) little\ndoubt that, as of the mid-1920s, many Soviet citizens were enthusiastic about\nthe future of their country.’\n\nThe game was spreading outside the USSR too. A fascinating insight into the\nmindset of the convert can be found in an [essay by author\nArthur](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos974373) Koestler, who joined the\nCommunist Party in Germany in 1931. After the economic crash decimated the\nmiddle classes, Koestler witnessed them fleeing to the far left and far right.\nIn the Communist Manifesto he read Marx’s prediction that ‘entire sections of\nthe ruling classes’ would supply the movement with ‘fresh elements of\nenlightenment and progress’. He liked the sound of that: ‘That “fresh element\nof enlightenment,” I discovered to my delight, was I.’\n\nOnce he’d joined, the rules and symbols began being written into Koestler’s\ngame-playing equipment. Just as we’ve encountered in the worlds of the Eton\nschoolboys and Heaven’s Gate, membership was symbolised in esoteric language.\nAfter being handed his party card, he was told he should, from then on, say\n‘thou’ instead of ‘you’. He discovered that ‘spontaneous’ wasn’t used, due to\nits association with Leon Trotsky, who’d by then become a class enemy.\nLikewise, there was no such thing as a ‘lesser evil’, which was a\n‘philosophical, strategical and tactical fallacy; a Trotskyite, diversionist,\nliquidatorial and counter-revolutionary conception’. Words and phrases in\nfavour included ‘the toiling masses’, ‘sectarian’, ‘herostratic’ and\n‘concrete’ (as in, ‘You must put your question into a more concrete form,\nComrade’). During the Nazi clampdown, one woman known to Koestler betrayed her\nmembership of the party by her use of the word ‘concrete’. ‘The Gestapo\nCommissar had listened to her with boredom, half-convinced that his underlings\nhad blundered in arresting her – until she used the fatal word for the second\ntime.’\n\nAs the game increasingly colonised Koestler’s neural territory, and his copy,\nflatter, conform circuitry switched on, he found his artistic and musical\ntastes became that of his elites: Lenin had read Balzac, so now Balzac was\n‘the greatest of all times’; any painting without a smoking factory chimney or\na tractor in it was dismissed as ‘escapist’. Truth itself became swallowed by\nthe dream. Any questioning of the party line was seen as sabotage; during\nmeetings they’d acclaim one another for taking turns to repeat correct\nbeliefs. The value of free speech was seen as deviant. ‘One of the slogans of\nthe German Party said: “The front-line is no place for discussions.” Another\nsaid: “Wherever a Communist happens to be, he is always in the front-line.”’\n\nJust as in the Heaven’s Gate cult, where people were instructed to hold a\n‘blank card’ up to incorrect thoughts, Koestler learned to think correctly. In\nhis early days, when he questioned the party’s analysis as being contrary to\nthe obvious truth, it was explained that he was still suffering from a\n‘mechanistic outlook’. Instead, he had to think ‘dialectically’ and interpret\nthe world through the eyes of the party.",

Instead, he had to think ‘dialectically’ and interpret\nthe world through the eyes of the party. ‘Gradually I learned to distrust my\nmechanistic preoccupation with facts and to regard the world around me in the\nlight of dialectic interpretation. It was a satisfactory and indeed blissful\nstate; once you had assimilated the technique you were no longer disturbed by\nfacts; they automatically took on the proper colour and fell into their proper\nplace.’ Like the cult members, Koestler found himself willingly lost in the\ndream of his game. ‘We craved to become single and simple-minded.’ As the game\ngripped in, and he strove for status within it, this highly intelligent man’s\ngrip on reality loosened more and more: ‘Faith is a wondrous thing; it is not\nonly capable of moving mountains, but also of making you believe that a\nherring is a race horse.’\n\nBack in the USSR, the perfect classless utopia was still taking its time. In\n1921, to give the economy a shove, Lenin introduced a ‘New Economic Policy’\n(NEP) that would take cues from capitalism: for example, [some small\nbusinesses would](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos974646) be permitted;\nthe [taking of grain from](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos974980)\npeasants would be replaced with taxation. [The economy grew\nrapidly](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos975277). But the NEP was never\npopular amongst the righteous, who called it a [‘new exploitation\nof](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos975595) the proletariat’.\n\nLenin’s health began to fail; he died in 1924. His successor Stalin replaced\nthe NEP with a programme of rapid industrialisation and the forced\ncollectivisation of farms. Armed squads were sent into the countryside to\nreorganise the practice of agriculture. They were also to fetch grain to feed\nthe nation and fund the building of the glorious future in which they’d\nsurpass their rivals in the West. [‘We are\nadvancing](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos975930) full steam ahead along\nthe path of industrialization – to socialism, leaving behind the age-old\n“Russian” backwardness,’ he wrote. ‘We are becoming a country of metal, a\ncountry of automobiles, a country of tractors. And when we have put the USSR\non an automobile, and the peasant on a tractor, let the worthy capitalists,\nwho boast so much of their “civilization”, try to overtake us! We shall see\nwhich countries may then be classified as backward and which as advanced.’\n\nWith this new assault on the countryside, the witch-hunt directed at the most\ncompetent peasants, who’d [once produced nearly\nthree](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos976263)-quarters of the nation’s\ncommercial grain, began once more. Stalin sought the [‘liquidation of\nthe](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos976563) kulaks as a class’. In the\n[first two months of](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos976879) 1930 alone,\nabout sixty million peasants were forced into collective farms.

Such journeys had a mortality rate of around 15\nper cent. One witness recalled becoming [‘used to\nseeing](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos977893) corpses there in the\nmorning; a wagon would pull up and the hospital stable-hand, Abram, would pile\nin the bodies. Not all died; many wandered through the dusty mean little\nstreets, dragging bloodless blue legs, swollen from dropsy, feeling out each\npasserby with doglike begging eyes … they got nothing.’\n\n[In 1933 around five](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos978172) thousand\nkulaks and ‘déclassé elements’ were dumped on an island in the Ob River with\nonly a few bags of mouldering flour to eat. Some attempted to swim to shore\nand drowned in icy water; others turned on each other and were killed for a\npair of shoes or a hunk of bread. Some of the people were eaten. On one day\nalone five bodies were discovered from which, [‘the liver,\nthe](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos978519) heart, the lungs and the\nfleshy parts of the bodies (breasts, calves) had been cut off’, according to\nan official report. [A witness remembered\na](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos978787) ‘pretty girl’ a young guard\nnamed Kostia Venikov had been courting. ‘He protected her. One day he had to\nbe taken away for a while, and he told one of his comrades, “Take care of her”\n… People caught the girl, tied her to a poplar tree, cut off her breasts, her\nmuscles, everything they could eat … When Kostia came back, she was still\nalive. He tried to save her but she had lost too much blood. She died. [The\nboy was out of luck](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos979061).’ Across the\nSoviet prison system, cannibalism was common enough that a name was coined for\nthose doomed to be eaten: cows. Stalin’s interpreter and subsequent gulag\ninmate Jacques Rossi writes, ‘the “cow” is a novice whom the convicts ask to\njoin them in attempting to escape. In general, the novice is flattered to find\nhimself associating with famous criminals. However, he does not know that if\nthey run short of food, he will be killed, and his blood eaten.’\n\nFor those responsible for the ‘dekulakisation’ of the USSR, status was awarded\nfor actively suppressing natural human sympathy.

[A decree in\n1932](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos980325) ordered ten years’ hard\nlabour or the death penalty for ‘any theft or damage of socialist property’,\nwhich included taking a few stalks of grain for food; [peasants began eating\ngrass and tree bark](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos980597).

The destruction of the kulaks was [a ‘catastrophe\nfor](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos981134) the Soviet economy’, writes\nFiges. ‘It deprived the collective farms of the best and hardest-working\npeasants, because these are what the “kulaks” actually were, ultimately\nleading to the terminal decline of the Soviet agricultural sector.’ [At the\nstart of](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos981470) the 1930s goods began\ndisappearing from shops in the towns and cities; severe shortages of foods,\nclothes and other essentials began. By 1933, according to economist Professor\nAlec Nove, the USSR had suffered [‘the most\nprecipitous](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos981852) peacetime decline in\nliving standards known in recorded history’.\n\nThen, in 1936, the harvest failed.\n\nSomeone must be to blame for the revolution’s problems. It obviously couldn’t\nbe the Communists. Who was it then? Hostile forces plotting against the\nrevolution: deviants, secret capitalists, witches. The problem was finding\nthem. This was an extremely tight game that had, by now, been being played for\nnearly two decades: conformity was the defining mode of life. [The party\ndidn’](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos982140)t accept the concept of the\nprivate life. ‘Everything people did in private was ‘political’,’ writes\nFiges, and as such ‘was subject to the censure of the collective’. A pro-\nCommunist writer, visiting the USSR from France in 1936, [commented on the\n‘](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos982518)extraordinary uniformity’ in\ndress in the people he encountered, adding ‘no doubt it would be equally\napparent in their minds … the individual is sunk in the mass and so little\nparticularized that one feels as though in speaking of people here one ought\nto use a collective singular and say not, “here are men” but “here is some\nman”’.\n\nBut if everybody was saying they believed the Communist dream, how could we\nfind out who the deviants were?

No, it is a mistake.’\n\nThe [elites and former elites](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos984049)\ncame under heavy suspicion: members of the pre-revolutionary intelligentsia\nwere [smeared as ‘bourgeois](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos984334)\nspecialists’. Also attacked were [priests, kulaks and the so-\ncalled](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos984606) ‘Nepmen’ – the\nentrepreneurs who’d run those small businesses during Lenin’s NEP. Many who\nwere suspected of incorrect thought were interrogated about their beliefs at\npurge meetings. [‘“Going through](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos984937)\nthe Purge” meant confessing your sins endlessly, especially membership of\noppositions and bad social origin,’ writes Fitzpatrick, ‘but there was no\nprovision in the ritual for being relieved of the burden.

These new upwardly mobile classes were encouraged\nfurther by Stalin’s stunning turning away from the founding dream of perfect\nequality. Rather than there being no social classes, he declared [there were\nactually three](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos990864): workers, peasants\nand intelligentsia. [Old symbols of\nhierarchy](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos991139), including degrees and\nhonorary titles, were brought out of abolishment just as new titles such as\n‘The Hero of the Soviet Union’ and ‘The Distinguished Master of Sport’ were\nintroduced.

[He\nderided it as ‘equality\nmongering](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos991426)’. He defended the\nnotion of citizens owning their own cattle: [‘a person\nis](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos991975) a person’, he said. ‘He wants\nto own something for himself.’ There was ‘nothing wrong in this’.\n\nThere’d [once been a ‘](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos992295)Party\nMaximum’ wage cap, even for those at the top. Not anymore. [Stalin ‘vigorously\ndemanded](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos992629) that individual skills\nand efforts be rewarded with higher wages and other material rewards’, writes\nsociologist Professor Jukka Gronow. ‘In his opinion, it had now become\nnecessary to encourage workers to get personally interested in the results of\ntheir own work.’ Hundreds of thousands of players became more prosperous. But\nwhat use was money when there were so few status symbolising goods to spend it\non? [‘The authorities clearly](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos992897)\nunderstood, new and higher quality material goods, along with the shops to\nsell them, were crucial.’\n\nIn 1936, following a personal intervention by Stalin, [the Soviet champagne\nindustry](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos993150) was born.

Many of these servants were provided with no\nbed and forced to sleep in the kitchen, under a table or on chairs. ‘They are\neven worse than the “ladies” of earlier times, these wives of engineers,\ndoctors and “responsible” cadres,’ said one brave complainant. They managed to\ncalm the dissonance of their elevated lifestyles partly via the dodge that,\nunder Communism, they didn’t actually own any of these amenities. They\nbelonged to the state. Privilege, for them, was about access instead of\nownership – and abolishing ownership was the whole point of this, right? As\nfor the state itself, it argued their privilege was temporary: soon all of the\nUSSR would live like this. They were not a privileged elite, went the\nthinking, [they were a vanguard](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos998335).\n\nThe elite in the Communist Party, including administrators and higher army and\ngovernment officials, became known as the nomenklatura. In 1933, at the height\nof the famine during which kulaks were eating grass, tree bark and each other,\n[luxury trains](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos998620) were taking its\nmembers on holidays to health spas in the south.

It’s a life in which everything\nflows easily … You are like a king: just point your finger and it is done.’ By\nthe time the Soviet Union collapsed, the nomenklatura and their families\nnumbered around three million, about 1.5 per cent of the population. This,\nobserves historian Professor Richard Pipes, is ‘approximately the same\nproportion of nobles under tsarism in the eighteenth century. And the favors\nit enjoyed resembled those of the magnates of that age.’\n\nWhat had gone wrong? Communism was supposed to bring about a [‘kingdom of\nequality](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos999163)’. It wasn’t that the\nSoviet Union had been merely unlucky in having Lenin and Stalin lead it, or\nthat their class-ridden tyranny was somehow peculiar to their cultural\ncharacter: hierarchies and horrors emerged also in Cambodia and China. In\nfact, the error the Communists made can be traced back to the arguments of\nPlato. More than two thousand years before the revolution, the Ancient Greek\nwho’d first dreamed the Communist dream [had been corrected\nby](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos999409) his student, Aristotle, who’d\npointed out it wasn’t actually wealth or private ownership that created the\nhuman yearning to get ahead. That yearning was a part of our nature: ‘it is\nnot possession but the desires of mankind which require to be equalized’.\n\nThe parable of the Communists reveals the impossibility of ridding human\nexistence of the game. The drive to get ahead will always assert itself. It’s\nin us. It’s who we are. The first decades of the Soviet Union find the status\ngame in all its details: its irrepressibility; its capacity to raise violence;\nthe grandiosity it inspires in winning players and leaders; the inevitability\nof elites; the flaw that makes people believe they’re always deserving of more\nstatus; the use of humiliation as the ultimate weapon; the horror of the\ncousins and their genius for tyranny; the ideological war games that rage\nacross neural territories; our vulnerability to believing almost any dream of\nreality if our status depends on it; the capacity for that dream to pervert\nour perception of reality; the danger of active belief; esoteric language;\nzealous leaders who cast visions of heavenly status in future promised lands\nand target enemies to its rising; the anger and enthusiasm they inspire; the\ncycle of gossip, outrage, consensus and harsh punishment; the paranoia that\ncan afflict leaders and the terrors it brings; the grim magic of toxic\nmorality and its conjuring trick of making evil seem virtuous; the necessity\nof games to generate status if they’re to endure; the world-changing power of\nthe status goldrush.\n\nThe story idealists sometimes tell of humanity says we’re natural seekers of\nequality. This isn’t true. Utopians talk of injustice whilst building new\nhierarchies and placing themselves at the top. We all do this. It’s in our\nnature. The urge for rank is ineradicable.

To persuade us to push a\npenis in and out of a vagina, it invented orgasm. To persuade us to sacrifice\nour wellbeing for a screaming, shit-smeared infant, it made love. To persuade\nus to force mashed-up foreign objects down our throats, it evolved taste and\nappetite. To persuade us to engage in groupish, co-operative living, it\nconjured the obsessive joys of connection and acclaim. Follow the rules, and\nfollow them well, and you can expect to feel great.\n\nBut, as we’ve discovered, the game of life contains hidden rules and traps.\nMany of the problems of social existence are generated in the disconnect\nbetween reality and the illusion, as the brain tricks us into believing the\nmyths and prejudices of our groups, and convinces us that we’re not players of\ngames but moral heroes in stories. This makes our species liable to becoming\nhubristic, aggressive and deluded. As we play for ever-greater status, for\nourselves and our games, we weave a self-serving and highly motivating dream\nthat writhes with saints and demons and irrational beliefs. This dream is\npresented to us as reality. It’s entirely convincing, in all its colour, noise\nand pristine focus. We see evidence everywhere that it’s true. It has the\npower to seduce us into the most depraved acts of hatred and barbarity. But it\ncan also lead us into modes of play that truly make a better world.\n\nIf the dream is so persuasive, how do we know we’re playing the right games?\nAnd when we’re playing them, how can we win what we need? To help improve our\nlives, and protect ourselves from peril, we can remember seven rules.\n\nI\n\nPractise Warmth, Sincerity and Competence\n\nEver since the days of the hunter-gatherer tribe, prestige has been freely\nawarded by our co-players. The ways in which we present to people socially can\nhave a huge effect on how much they’ll grant us. Psychologists studying\noptimal self-presentation discuss a set of closely related ideas. [Professor\nSusan Fiske argues](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos999750) that, when\nencountering others, people ask of them two fundamental questions: ‘What are\ntheir intentions?’ and ‘What’s their capacity to pursue them?’ If we want to\nsupply the right answers, and so be received positively, Fiske finds we should\nbehave in ways that imply [warmth and\ncompetence](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1000151). More recently it’s\nbeen argued a third component should be added. For Professor Jennifer Ray,\nmorality is [‘not only a](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1000481)\ncritical and separable dimension … it may even be the primary dimension’.\nElsewhere, ‘perceived sincerity’ has been found to be essential to successful\n‘impression management’.\n\nTaking these arguments from a status game perspective, I believe we can\nusefully settle on three dimensions for successful play: warmth, sincerity and\ncompetence. This constitutes a kind of blessed triumvirate of human behaviour\nand, whilst undoubtedly being easier said than done, it at least offers an\nideal to aim at.

As we’ve learned, there are three major routes to status in\nhuman games: we can grab it in acts of dominance or we can earn prestige by\nproving ourselves useful to our group, with acts that signal virtue or\nsuccess. When we’re warm, we imply we’re not going to use dominance; when\nsincere, that we’re going to play fairly; when competent, that we’re going to\nbe valuable to the game itself, both in its own battles for status, and to\nindividual players who might learn from us.\n\nFor leaders, this warmth, sincerity, competence rule is slightly different.\nWhilst warmth can certainly be advisable, especially when dealing with\npampered elites, it’s perhaps more critical to show zeal on behalf of the\ngame. Throughout history, leaders have succeeded by telling a story that says\ntheir group is deserving of more status, which, under their direction, they’ll\nwin. But it remains important this evangelical passion doesn’t morph into\narrogance. No one likes a big shot.\n\nII\n\nMake Small Moments of Prestige\n\nWe find it all too easy to make small moments of dominance. During our\ninvestigation, we focussed on dominance play in some of its strongest\nmanifestations. Caren Turner, the online mobbers, mass-murderers and the\ntyrannical cousins of history all attempted to attain elevated status by\nforce. Like them, we’re vulnerable to slipping into these second-self states\nand, in overwhelming moments, making mistakes we might even regret for life.\nBut just as consequential are the accumulations of damage we can cause with\nsubtle moments of dominance. The glowers, the sighs, the wails of complaint:\nsuch twitches of animalism might help us achieve some immediate goal, but\nthey’ll lead to our being de-ranked in the minds of others.\n\nOften, these incidents of pointless tension are the result of our game-playing\ncircuitry never switching off. We’re routinely pitched into senseless\ncompetitions at the hyper-local level. When we’re in airport security queues\nor on the phone to call centres, we can remind ourselves the person we’re\ndealing with might be obstructive or rude, but we don’t have to take it as a\nchallenge to our rank. We can consciously override any urge to push back in\ndominance and provide, instead, a prestigious response, by offering respect\nand acclaim for their efforts. We might not get what we want (although our\nchances could improve) but at least everyone will leave feeling better about\nwho we are as a person – including ourselves. In this way, accumulations of\ndominance become accumulations of prestige, leading to potentially dramatic\nimprovements in reputation over time, and all the rewards that can bring.\n\nIt’s easy to forget we have status to give, that it costs nothing and it never\nruns out. Creating small moments of prestige means always seeking\nopportunities to use it. Allowing others to feel statusful makes it more\nlikely they’ll accept our influence. Whether we’re asking a favour or issuing\na task to a subordinate, it’s advisable to resist even subtle markers of\ndominance, allowing them to reach the ‘correct’ decision without putting them\nunder pressure.

But,\nresearchers find, in individualist societies, [‘evoking\nfreedom’](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1002835) can have significant\npower to persuade. In one study, telling a stranger they were ‘free to accept\nor refuse’ a request for money for bus fare increased compliance from 16 to 40\nper cent. I suspect this is largely down to status: if someone feels coerced\ninto doing the ‘right’ thing, even if gently, they’ve only agreed out of\ndominance. This means the status isn’t theirs to enjoy, it’s with the player\nto whom they’ve deferred. But if they believe they’ve decided freely, they’re\nnot weak but virtuous and so able to rightfully enjoy their generosity’s\nreward.\n\nIII\n\nPlay a Hierarchy of Games\n\nOne of the greatest dangers in this game of life is tyranny. Resisting it\nmeans understanding that tyranny is fun. It tempts us in with the lure of\nmajor status. Especially in the modern era, when wars tend to rage over\npsychological rather than physical territory, tyrants don’t succeed by telling\npeople they’re wrong. Instead, they start by saying what we already believe.\nTheir arguments make moral sense. Who could be against the end of the cruel\nexploitation of the Russian masses? Who could be against the restoration of\nthe German economy and national pride, and the ridding of the Communist\nmenace? Who could be against fighting child abuse? The Communists, Nazis and\nSatan-hunters each offered a game that felt virtuous and hopeful. Their\nleaders told their players a story that they wanted to hear – they were right,\nthey were moral heroes and they were on a glorious path to a promised land of\nelevated status. Their players came to experience the dream they’d been sold\nas true: they believed, fully and sincerely, they were on the side of the\ngood.\n\nGiven the game’s ability to mould our perception of reality, how can we know\nif we’ve been seduced? It’s possible to sense what kind of game we’re in by\nobserving the ways in which status is typically awarded. Tyrannies are virtue-\ndominance games. Much of their daily play and conversation will focus on\nmatters of obedience, belief and enemies. Is the game you’re playing coercing\npeople, both inside and outside it, into conforming to its rules and symbols?\nDoes it attempt to silence its ideological foes? Does it tell a simplistic\nstory that explains the hierarchy, deifying their group whilst demonising a\ncommon enemy? Are those around you obsessed with their sacred beliefs? Do they\ntalk about them continually and with greedy pleasure, drawing significant\nstatus from belief and active belief? Does it seek to damage and destroy\nlives, often with glee? Is this aggression made to feel virtuous? That’s\nprobably a tyranny. This might sound melodramatic, but we all contain the\ncapacity for this dreadful mode of play: those cousins are built into our\ncoding. If we’re serious about ‘never again’ we must accept that tyranny isn’t\na ‘left’ thing or a ‘right’ thing, it’s a human thing. It doesn’t arrive\ngoose-stepping down streets in terrifying ranks, it seduces us with stories.\n\nPerhaps the best mode of protection is to play many games. People who appear\nbrainwashed have invested too much of their identity into a single game. They\nrely on it wholly for their connection and status, the maintenance of which\nrequires them to be filled up with its dream of reality, no matter how\ndelusional. Not only does this put them at risk of committing harm to others,\nthey risk catastrophic collapse themselves.",

Not only does this put them at risk of committing harm to others,\nthey risk catastrophic collapse themselves. If the game fails, or they become\nexpelled, their identity – their very self – can disintegrate. No such risk\ncan befall the player with a diversity of identities who plays diverse games.\nIndeed, doing so seems to be profoundly good for us. Psychologists find [those\nwith ‘complex](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1003309),’ multiple self-\nidentities tend to be happier, healthier and have more stable emotional lives.\n\nBut it’s important, too, that every game isn’t played with equal focus. If\nwe’re going to earn the prestige we desire, we must strive to become truly\nvaluable to our co-players. This takes time. It requires an amount of dogged\nattention to one pursuit over others. Life, then, should be organised as a\nhierarchy of games, with that at the top drawing the most effort and\ngenerating maximal meaning.\n\nIV\n\nReduce Your Moral Sphere\n\nSome forms of status are easier to win than others. For those of us who aren’t\npretty, virtue is probably the easiest to find of all. It’s as simple as\njudging people: because status is relative, their de-grading raises us up, if\nonly in our minds. Smartphones and social media have placed global virtue\ngames inside our pockets. Winning this form of status is now more convenient\nthan ever. But it costs, not least in the misery it can cause others,\nespecially when it’s blended with dominance. Many of us could benefit from\nconsciously reducing our moral sphere. How much time do you devote to the\njudging of other people? How much cheap and tainted status do you grab for\nyourself by doing so? Reducing our moral sphere means casting our eyes\ninwards, concerning ourselves mostly with our own behaviour instead of that of\nothers. It means ceasing the casual condemnation of distant players living\ndifferent dreams which we refuse to understand and are all too easy to\nbelittle and hate.\n\nV\n\nFoster a Trade-Off Mindset\n\nThe drug of morality poisons empathy. Because the dreamworlds we live in seem\nreal and true, we believe the moral convictions that comprise them are also\nreal and true, as if they’re objects that can be dug out of the ground and\nobserved by all, just as long as we make the right arguments. But moral\n‘facts’ exist only in minds. Our insistence on their materiality blinds us to\nthe perspectives of others: if our moral reality is reality then theirs must\nbe a lie. So they’re liars, then. Evil.\n\nThis mode of thinking trips us into arguing over questions with no answer.\nAsking whether immigration or neoliberalism or religion are ‘good’ or ‘bad’ is\nnonsensical. It’s pure status play. Which moral class we assign them depends\non which game we happen to be playing. The truth of such complex phenomena is\nusually that they’re trade-offs: they have an array of positive and negative\neffects that impact different status games in different ways.\n\nRather than fighting to make our moral truths classed as materially real and\ndeferred to absolutely, we should foster a trade-off mindset. This means\nviewing the world not in terms of winners and losers but of groups negotiating\ntrade-offs. It means reaching past the self-serving fantasy of moral heroes\nand villains and seeing the ways different outcomes might injure our foes,\nwhose pain is just as painful as ours.",

And it means empathising; sincerely\nattempting to understand the games played by our enemies and acknowledging\ntheir criteria for making status, even if we can never persuade ourselves of\ntheir validity.\n\nMost of the time, in even intensely bitter conflicts, each side tells a story\nthat holds part of the truth. We found this in the clashing narratives of the\nNew Left and New Right. Both wove a dream that was simultaneously true and\nfalse: the nuanced reality is we need to ensure minorities have every\nopportunity to thrive, just as we need to understand that the alienation felt\nby the white and in-need exists, and hurts them. We must fight the bigotry of\nwhich both sides are guilty. Immigration isn’t ‘good’ or ‘bad’, it’s a deal\nthat impacts different sets of people in different ways. The route forward is\nmore likely to be found if we muster the wisdom to see through the moral\ncartoon and understand the world not as populated by dragons and dragon\nslayers, but by players negotiating trade-offs.\n\nVI\n\nBe Different\n\nLife in the status game can be tough, not least in the hyper-individualist,\nneoliberal world in which we play today. Research suggests it’s changing us:\nwe’re more sensitive to signals of failure in our environment and that makes\nus more perfectionistic. The standards by which we judge ourselves as being\nworthy are often so high, we settle for nothing less than perfect. But there\nis another way. Psychologists argue it’s possible to earn success-based status\nby engaging in [‘minor acts of](../Text/index_split_039.html#filepos1003587)\nnonconformity that do not violate the group’s basic standards for behaviour\nbut attract attention’. Doing your own thing takes imagination and courage,\nbut as long as you’re being useful, and not breaking sacred rules, you have\nthe potential to rise. Originality also makes it more difficult for rivals to\ncatch you. This should be a relief to those of us who obsess, damagingly, over\nour failure to be perfect. Often, a better strategy lies in trying to be\ndifferent.\n\nVII\n\nNever Forget You’re Dreaming\n\nA status game is a conspiracy we join to make ourselves feel important. Once\nour basic survival needs have been met, and we’re connected with others,\nwhat’s left is the contest. And for what? It’s not as if we can go to some\nbunker in the desert, unlock a steel box and find our status inside it. We\ncan’t take our status to bed and give it a kiss. We concoct it, as if by\nmagic, out of those endless symbols: deference, influence, money, flattery,\neye contact, clothing, jewellery, professional titles, measures of orange\njuice, left or right on the plane. We invest the years of our lives into\nprojects that become of all-devouring importance. Up and down and up and down\nand up and down we go. As we live, we soar and fall, our victories ecstatic,\nour losses so grave we can be driven to suicide, the bitterness of death\nseeming sweeter than failure.\n\nWhilst we can never separate ourselves from the game, wisdom can be gained\nfrom simply knowing that it’s there. In the years it’s taken me to undertake\nthis research, I’ve found its knowledge to be a comfort. This has come in a\nvariety of contexts. For instance, I write to you in my forty-fifth year. Not\ntoo long ago, I’d sometimes feel self-conscious about my age and its various\nsigns.",

Not\ntoo long ago, I’d sometimes feel self-conscious about my age and its various\nsigns. I now realise these signs are symbols in a game I’m no longer required\nto play. Competing with the young in games of youth is not just hopeless, it’s\ndull. The trick is to find new and better games. There are different worlds to\nexplore, in the second half of life, most more meaningful than those of the\nfirst.\n\nI’m also more conscious of my thoughts, and their capacity to twist into self-\nserving stories. I catch myself ruminating hotly on events, automatically\nweaving a moral tale of heroes and villains around small humiliations and\nglobal headlines. There are always status battles at the core of these\nimaginings; they come when I feel threatened. By noticing this happening, I’m\nnow better able to hinder the process, to step outside it and restore at least\na modicum of rationality.\n\nJust as I’m aware of my own vulnerability to being swept into perilous\nfantasies, I’m aware of the extraordinary power of groups to do so. In what’s\nbecoming an increasingly angry and divided era, in the West, my knowledge of\nthe game has enabled me to observe with a greater sense of assurance as new,\nwild dreams have formed across the culture and bewitched the masses. I’m\nbetter able to defend my own perception in the understanding that, just\nbecause large crowds of smart people have begun believing that which seems\ncrazy, it doesn’t necessarily follow that they’re right. The fact of their\nnumbers doesn’t increase their trustworthiness and neither does their power,\nplatform or intellect. Elites and their games have gone wrong throughout human\nhistory; there’s no reason they should stop in our lifetime.\n\nFinally, I’ve learned to recognise when the pressures of the game become\noverwhelming. In this strange and restless dreamworld, we’re continually\noffered new and shifting symbols of what it is to be a winner: thinner,\nlarger, whiter, darker, smarter, happier, brave-and-sadder with this career\ntriumph and that many likes. I remind myself that these symbols we chase are\noften no less ridiculous than giant yams and that none of us are competing\nwith everyone in the world, no matter how much it can feel that way.\n\nI believe we can all take consolation in the knowledge that nobody ever gets\nthere, not the superstars, the presidents, the geniuses or the artists we gaze\nup at in envy and awe. That promised land is a mirage. It’s a myth. In our\nlowest moments, we should remind ourselves of the truth of the dream: that\nlife is not a story, but a game with no end. This means it isn’t a final\nvictory we should seek but simple, humble progress: the never-ending pleasure\nof moving in the right direction. Nobody wins the status game. They’re not\nsupposed to.

Most of the ideas\ncovered in this book are well documented in a wide range of books, academic\npapers and periodicals which were my principal source for research. Most of\nthe general concepts in this book are relatively uncontroversial. In the few\nareas where I explored more controversial science, I sought expert counsel\nwhere those studies threatened to be too complex for a lay person to\nappropriately understand. I then recruited a team of academics with\nappropriate specialisms to read the manuscript. They offered notes and advice\nwhere I had erred. I offer my huge thanks to Dr Stuart Ritchie, Professor\nSophie Scott and William Buckner of the Human Systems and Behavior Lab who all\nhelped in this regard, and were brilliant and patient with my questions.\nFurther fact-checking was carried out by Madeleine Feeny and Isaac Scher. I\naccept full responsibility for any remaining errors.\n\nI do not declare myself to be free of the biases that afflict any writer, and\nI’m certainly not immune to making mistakes. If any errors of fact are noted,\nor if new findings supersede claims made in the text, I would be very grateful\nto receive notification via my website, willstorr.com, so that future editions\nof The Status Game can be corrected and updated.\n\nNaturally, this book contains only a fraction of the relevant science. Other\nacademics will, surely, disagree with those whom I quote in these pages. If\nany of it piques your interest, I urge you to dig deeper, where you will no\ndoubt find science that is newer and in conflict with some of the work here.\n\nAll interviews are edited. Some quotes have had their tenses switched, for\nease of reading.

The banks\ninvolved would be listed in a full-page advertisement, their precise\nplacements denoting their relative status, with the upper left segment being\ntop rank. Bankers would obsess about their placement and back out of deals if\nunsatisfied. In 1979 Morgan Stanley walked away from an offering with IBM, who\nthey’d been servicing for twenty years, because they were displeased with\ntheir ranking in an advertisement, shrugging off a roughly one-million-dollar\nfee.

Firstly, people aren’t so\n> harsh if we claim our success is due to hard work rather than natural\n> talent, the latter perhaps seeming less deserved and therefore more\n> infuriating. Secondly, and pleasingly, we’re also bad at predicting how\n> confessions of our failures will land: people tend to believe an observer\n> ‘will judge them more harshly for mishaps or debacles than is actually the\n> case’.

Design is an ever-evolving profession. If you’re like me, \none of your goals as a graphic designer is to always improve \nyour skills so that you can attract the clients you want. So it’s \nvital that you keep learning and growing.\nThis book is about sharing with you everything that I know \nabout creating brand identities so that you can stay motivated \nand inspired, and make smart and well-informed decisions when \nprocuring and working with your clients.\nBut who am I, and what reason do you have for heeding\nmy advice?\nWell, for a number of years I’ve been sharing design projects on \nmy blogs at davidairey.com and logodesignlove.com. In these \nblogs, I walk my readers through the individual stages of my \nidentity design projects. I talk about how I sealed the deal with \na client. I examine the details of a design brief. And I describe \nhow a client might sign off on polished artwork.\nMy websites currently generate 1 million monthly page views \nand have a combined subscriber count of more than 30,000 \nreaders. That’s quite a lot for a young lad from Bangor,\nNorthern Ireland. My readers tell me that reading my blogs \nmakes them feel like they’re getting to go “behind the scenes”\nIntroduction",

They say that my features are helpful, \ninspiring, and very much appreciated (and I didn’t pay them\nfor their comments, I promise!). \nIf you search through the portfolios of the most successful \ndesign agencies and studios, you’ll ﬁ nd plenty of examples of \nﬁ nal design work. Some portfolios might even show one or two \nalternative concepts. For the most part, however, we can ﬁ nd \nvery little of what actually happens between designers and their \nclients: the questions they ask to get projects started on the \nright foot, how they generate ideas after creating and studying \nthe design brief, and how they present their designs to win their \nclient’s approval. Such details are like gold dust to a designer.\nAnd so, the idea for this book was born.\nNever before have I gone into so much detail about my design \nprocess, and never before have I studied the intricacies in such \ndepth. In the process, I’ve brought many talented designers and \ndesign studios on board who very graciously have shared their \nown thoughts, processes, and advice.\nWhen you ﬁ nish reading this book, you hopefully will be \nwell-prepared to go out and win your own clients and create \nyour own iconic brand identities.

Because people often choose \nproducts based on their perceived value rather than their\nactual value. \nThink about the celebrity who drives an Aston Martin instead \nof, say, a Skoda, which is continually ranked “car of the year” in \nmany European countries and delivers much better mileage at a \nsigniﬁ cantly cheaper price.

Getting up to speed \non all these aspects requires a lot of indepth research, but the \ninvestment of time is worth it: Without a strong knowledge \nof your client’s world, you can’t hope to create a design that \nsuccessfully differentiates your client’s business from its\nclosest competitors.\nKeep in mind, though, that a \nlogo doesn’t have to go so \nfar as to literally reveal what \na company does. Think about \nthe BMW logo, for instance. It \nisn’t a car. And the Hawaiian \nAirlines logo isn’t an airplane. \nBut both stand out from the \ncompetition and are relevant \nwithin their respective worlds.\nHawaiian Airlines\nBy Lindon Leader\n1993",

They \neither represent a newly established company in need of a \nnew identity, or an already established company that desires a \nredesigned or reﬁ ned brand identity.\nIf your project falls into the ﬁ rst category—designing from \nscratch—the process is much simpler, since there’s no brand \nequity for the designer and client to consider. But if you’ve been \nasked to do a redesign, the stakes are much higher, for both \nyou and your client. Think about it. Which scenario is potentially \nmore damaging: Nike ditching its internationally recognized \n“swoosh” logo in favor of, say, the outline of a shoe, or a new \nbusiness named “Pete’s” comissioning a visual identity to help \nsell its custom t-shirts? Because of Nike’s stature, stock, and \nvisibility in the marketplace, the potential for damage to the \ncompany’s identity is much greater. \nThat said, a redesign project tends to be much more lucrative \nfor the designer than creating a design from scratch. Because \nestablished companies need to be protective of the equity \nthey have already built around their identity, a lengthier, more \nstringent design process is required.

It’s a relatively straightforward process of word \nassociation. You write a word that’s central to the design brief, \nand then branch out from it, writing other words that spring to \nmind. These additional words could come after some thought, \nor after researching the central topic. The idea is to form as \nlarge a “thought cloud” as possible, giving you a strong tool to \nrefer to when it comes to the next stage—sketching.\nChapter seven\nFrom pencil to PDF",

Moving forward, I’ll be referring to the decision-maker \nas the “committee,” since the clients you want to attract will \nprobably have more than one person involved in choosing a \nvisual identity. \nWorking directly with the committee for the duration of the \nproject isn’t always possible—most likely you will have been \nworking with a single point of contact (perhaps a brand \nmanager as opposed to a CEO or board of directors) at least \nsome of the time up until this point. But when it comes time to \ndeliver your design ideas, dealing with the committee is critical. \nThe last thing you want is for your carefully crafted explanations \nto devolve into a game of “phone tag,” in which rationales are \nconveyed and usually quickly distorted through a mediator.",

Remind your \nclient as often as necessary to focus on just the idea—the story \nbehind the design concept—not the intricacies of the mark, \nor the particular choice of typeface. These lesser details can \nbe ironed out when a single direction has been agreed upon. \nOtherwise, you could end up supplying revisions for more than \none direction, which is an unnecessary cost for both parties.\nKeep in mind, however, that things won’t always go your way. \nThroughout my years of self-employment, I’ve presented brand \nidentity projects to around 60 or 70 different clients. Two or \nthree of my earliest presentations were so unsuccessful that \nthey caused a stalemate in the process, and both my client and \nI lost out.

Work in black and white \nNo amount of fancy gradients or color choices will rescue a \npoorly designed mark.\nBy refraining from using color until the end of the process, you \nand your client are free from distractions of a preference for, \nsay, green, which leaves you free to focus on the idea.\n11. Keep it relevant\nAre you designing for a law ﬁ rm? Then ditch the fun approach. \nPerhaps your client produces a kid’s TV show. OK, so nothing \ntoo serious. Maybe you are designing for a Michelin star \nrestaurant. In this case, you’ll likely favor muted colors over \nbright, ﬂ uorescent ones.

So legibility is key, \nespecially when the brand isn’t well-known. For instance, a \nclient’s handwriting may look pretty, but if most people can’t \nread it immediately, then don’t consider using it as a logotype.\n13. Be consistent\nMany logos are accompanied by style guides, and the creation \nof these guides is your responsibility. They ensure that anyone \nwithin the client’s company who uses the design does so in \na consistent manner. Consistency breeds trust.

Offer a single-color version\nThe logo you design for your client might show a number of \ndifferent colors, but you must also supply a version that uses \njust one.

Pay attention to contrast\nWhen your logo is applied to the design of promotional\nmaterial or corporate stationery, you must keep an eye on \nthe contrast between the logo and its background, as well as \nbetween actual elements within the logo design. The tonal \nrange should be contrasting enough to allow the mark or \nsymbol to be clearly identiﬁ ed.\n17. Aid recognition\nKeeping your design simple makes it easier for people \nto recognize it the next time they see it. Consider large \ncorporations like Mitsubishi, Samsung, FedEx, and BBC.\nTheir logos are simple in appearance, and they’re easier to \nrecognize because of it. Keeping it simple also allows for \nﬂ exibility in size. Ideally, your logo will work at a minimum\nof around one inch without loss of detail.\n18. Test at a variety of sizes\nTry printing your work to ensure it’s clean, with a good level of \ncontrast on paper, and not pixelated. But don’t just print a single \nlogo. Replicate the design at a range of sizes and colors for \nvariation. There’s no point in using a full page of paper for just \none tiny design.",

This increases ﬂ exibility, \nand you’ll be appreciated for it.\n20. Turn it upside down\nJust because your design looks OK the right way up doesn’t \nmean it will look OK when viewed upside down.

An identity \nhelps manage the perception  \nof a company and differentiates  \nit from its competitors.

It is an ancient culture.\nMandarin and Cantonese are the main, but not the \nonly, Chinese dialects. \nChina’s trademark registration is competitive. \nBrands must be aware of the intellectual property \nregulations in China and incorporate this into their \nbrand development process.\nNaming\nChinese is a character-based language with \nessentially small picture icons conveying both \nmeaning and pronunciation. \nA Chinese name should reflect brand attributes, \nand does not need to be a direct translation of the \noriginal name. \nThe pronunciation and connotations of the \nChinese language vary greatly by region. Testing \nin the main Chinese dialects to avoid negative \nassociations is critical.\nCreating a local- or foreign-sounding Chinese \nname depends on the brand’s target consumer, \ncompetitors, cities, industry, and other \nmarketplace dynamics.\nSometimes Chinese names are chosen for the \nsimilarity of sound to the original brand name, but \nmore often for an associative and relevant \nmeaning.\nThe emphasis on auspiciousness, good fortune, \nhappiness, power, and status is important in \nChinese culture.\nIn 2011, trademark registration \napplications in China numbered \n1.41 million, a 32 percent \nincrease from the previous year \nand double the number in 2008.\nKleenex brand: Kimberly-Clark\nDecoding China’s cultural \ncodes is essential for \ncreating successful and \nmemorable brands. \nDenise Sabet\nVice GM\nLabbrand\nThe Chinese name for Kleenex \nmeans clean and comfort.\nEverwines is a wine retail chain in \nChina developed by Torres SA, a \nfourth-generation Spanish wine \nproducer. The final Chinese name \nchosen was \n (y\u001fong táo). \n \n(y\u001fong) means to sing or praise; it \nalso is pronounced the same as \n \n(y\u001fong, “forever”), thus corre-\nsponding to “Ever” in the English \nname. \n (táo) means grape, the \nsource of wine. \nEverwines: Labbrand",

Initially, \nprivate labeling was a business strategy aimed at \nhigher profit margins per product and increased \nrevenues. A private label product line is created \nand branded by a store, usually a large retail \nchain. The products themselves are produced by \na third-party supplier, which usually makes other \nname brand products for established national \nbrands. Companies like IKEA use the master \nbrand on all of their products, while companies \nlike Safeway and Aldi create multiple brands. \nSince it exists in branded environments, private label \ncan devote less energy to brand recognition, and more \nto great product stories.\nBruce Duckworth\nPrincipal, Turner Duckworth\nWe upped the quality, upped \nthe price, and we’re selling \nmore units. Because it’s the \nbest tuna you could buy.\nRichard Galanti\nChief Financial Officer\nCostco\nWaitrose: Turner Duckworth\nFor many retailers, private labeling has become a powerful marketing \nstrategy to build brand equity and a differentiator that gives consumers \nmore reasons to shop at their stores. The perceptual shift has begun \nfrom low quality to value-added, accelerated by more upscale and \nbetter-designed packaging, combined with insights about consumers’ \nunmet needs.",

Most people can recall a scenario in \nwhich the wrong decision was made because of \neither politics or too many decision makers. \nExperts in the social sciences believe that deci-\nsions made by large groups tend to be more \nconservative and less inspired than decisions \nmade by small groups. Yet organizational devel-\nopment experts may tell you that decision by \nconsensus has the potential to result in higher-­\nquality decisions because the organization uses \nthe resources of its members.\nThe path to reconciling these seemingly con-\nflicting points of view leads to a brand champion \nor CEO with strong leadership skills—someone \nwho can elicit ideas and opinions from a wider \ngroup without succumbing to group-­think. In an \nideal situation, the final decision makers, regard-\nless of the size of the organization, should be \nkept to a very small group led by the CEO. The \ngroup makes informed choices that are aligned \nwith the vision of the organization, and is involved \nthroughout the process at key decision points, \nfor example, agreement on goals, brand strategy, \nnames, taglines, and brandmarks.\nSmart organizations often use the branding pro-\ncess to refocus stakeholders on the vision and \nmission of the organization.

Cohen\nRatnerPrestia\nBrands outperform their rivals by establishing a \ndifference that they can express, sustain, and  \nlegally protect. The most successful brands \nstand out prominently in the marketplace in \nmany ways. They can employ—alone or in combi-\nnation—creative product and packaging designs, \nimproved functionality, and source-identifying \nsymbols like trademarks, logos, names, colors, \nand even vocal sounds. Consider Levi Strauss’s \ndistinctive jean pocket stitching, Intel’s sonic \nlogo, Tiffany’s robin’s-egg-blue packaging, and \nCoca-Cola’s iconic bottle design. Whether a  \ndistinctive feature appeals to a consumer’s  \npractical needs, or satisfies pure desire, it has \nlong-term value.\nIntellectual property refers to an intangible asset \nthat is the result of creativity and includes pat-\nents, trademarks, or copyrights. Laws governing \nintellectual property advance various policies. \nFederal trademark registration, for example, \nhelps ensure that the consumer is not confused \nor misled by source identifiers that are too  \nsimilar. Trademarks are always registered within \nindustry classes, of which there are forty-five, \nand may be registered in more than one class.\nIntellectual property law is the name of the  \nlegal discipline that specializes in providing the \nbroadest scope of protection for brand assets.  \nA trademark search and analysis by intellectual \nproperty counsel at the outset of a branding  \nprocess can proactively identify and mitigate \nrisks. It is the responsibility of the trademark \nowner to monitor the marketplace for infringe-\nment by others.\nUSPTO \nUS Patent and Trademark Office\nJPO \nJapan Patent Office\nEPO \nEuropean Patent Office\nSIPO \nState Intellectual Property Office \nof the People’s Republic of China",

Under \ninternational treaties, certain countries recognize \nUS trademark registrations as bases for filing  \nfor registrations in those countries.\nIntellectual property law is considered to be a \nspecialty and is practiced by counselors with \nspecific expertise.\nThe database of the US Patent and Trademark \nOffice can be used to search for existing federal \ntrademark applications and registrations, but \nintellectual property counselors are typically used \nto assess the legal opportunities and risks \nassociated with a brand identity strategy.\nBrand names, packages, labels, and marketing and \nadvertising materials for regulated industries like \nhealth care, pharmaceuticals, and financial \nservices require approvals by governing bodies \nprior to launch.\nRegistered Trademark: Federal \nregistration symbol that may only be \nused after the USPTO actually registers \na mark, and not while an application is \nmerely pending.\nTrademark: used to alert the public to \nyour claim of ownership of a mark.  \nIt may be used regardless of whether \nyou have filed an application with  \nthe USPTO.\nService Mark: is used to alert the \npublic to your claim of ownership of a \nunique service.\nIt may be used regardless of whether \nyou have filed an application with the \nUSPTO.\n®\nTM\nSM",

You \nshould have a compelling reason, and clear \nbusiness benefits, for going through the name \nchange process. Making a strong case for \nchange—whether legal, market-based, or other—\nwill help everyone involved rise above emotional \nissues and enable a more successful and \nmeaningful effort. \nAssess the impact of change. A name change \nis more complicated than creating a new name \nbecause it affects established brand equity and \nall existing brand communications. A thorough \naudit of equity and communication assets should \nbe conducted, to fully understand how a name \nchange will affect your investments and \noperations. \nKnow what your choices are. Depending on \nyour reason for change, it can be very difficult to \nconsider change in the abstract. It is much easier \nto commit to a change when you have alternative \nnames to consider that solve your \ncommunication issues.\nKnow what you are trying to say before you \nname it. Naming is a highly emotional issue that \ncan be hard to judge objectively. By first \nagreeing on what your new name should say, you \nconcentrate your efforts on choosing the name \nthat says it best. \nAvoid trendy names. By definition, these are \nnames that will lose their appeal over time.  \nChoosing a new name simply because it sounds \n“hip” or “cool” generally results in names that \nwear quickly.\n“Empty Vessel Names” require filling. Made-\nup or meaningless names will require more \ninvestment to build understanding, memorability, \nand proper spelling than names that have some \ninherent meaning. Compare the immediate \nmeaning and relevance of names like Google \nand Amazon to empty vessels like Kijiji and \nZoosk.\nAvoid names that are too specific. This may \nbe the reason that change was necessary in the \nfirst place. Names that identify a specific \ngeography, technology, or trend might be \nrelevant for a period of time, but in the long run \nthey could restrict your ability to grow. \nUnderstand that a new name can’t do \neverything. Names are powerful tools, but they \ndo not tell the whole story.  A name change \nalone—without rethinking of all brand \ncommunications—could risk being seen as \nsuperficial. Consider how new taglines, design, \ncommunications, and other context-building tools \nshould work with the new name to build a rich \nnew story that you can own. \nEnsure you can own it. Check patent and \ntrademark offices, common-law usages, URLs, \nTwitter handles, and regional/cultural sensitivities \nbefore you decide, and make the investment to \nprotect your name. This is best done by an \nexperienced intellectual property attorney.\nTransition with confidence. Make sure you \nintroduce your new name as part of a value-\noriented story that conveys clear benefits to your \nemployees, customers, and shareholders. The \nmessage “we’ve changed our name” on its own \ngenerally falls flat. Commit to the change with \nconfidence and implement as quickly and \nefficiently as possible. Having two names in the \nmarket at the same time is confusing to both \ninternal and external audiences. \nIf you wish to make a \nmeaningful statement, a name \nchange is not enough. The \nname should represent a \nunique, beneficial, and \nsustainable story that resonates \nwith customers, investors, and \nemployees.\nPhilip Durbrow\nChairman and CEO\nMarshall Strategy\nCompanies change their names \nfor many reasons, but in every \ncase, a clear rationale for \nchange with strong business \nand brand benefits is critical.\nKen Pasternak\nManaging Director\nMarshall Strategy",

Design is an \niterative process that seeks to integrate meaning with form. The best \ndesigners work at the intersection of strategic imagination, intuition, design \nexcellence, and experience. \nExamine\nMeaning\nAttributes\nAcronyms\nInspiration\nHistory\nForm\nCounterform\nAbstract\nPictorial\nLetterform\nWordmark\nCombination\nTime\nSpace\nLight\nStill\nMotion\nTransition\nPerspective\nReality\nFantasy\nStraight\nCurve\nAngle\nIntersection\nPatterns\nReducing a complex idea to its visual essence \nrequires skill, focus, patience, and unending disci-\npline. A designer may examine hundreds of ideas \nbefore focusing on a final choice. Even after a  \nfinal idea emerges, testing its viability begins yet \nanother round of exploration. It is an enormous \nresponsibility to design something that in all prob-\nability will be reproduced hundreds of thousands, \nif not millions, of times and has a lifetime of \ntwenty years or more. \nCreativity takes many roads. In some offices \nnumerous designers work on the same idea, \nwhereas in other offices each designer might  \ndevelop a different idea or positioning strategy. \nRoutinely hundreds of sketches are put up on the \nwall for a group discussion. Each preliminary \napproach can be a catalyst to a new approach. It \nis difficult to create a simple form that is bold, \nmemorable, and appropriate because we live in \nan oversaturated visual environment, making it \ncritical to ensure that the solution is unique and \ndifferentiated. In addition, an identity will need to \nbe a workhorse across various media and \napplications.\nIn projects that involve redesign the designer \nmust also carefully examine the equity of the \nexisting form and understand what it has meant \nto a company’s culture. Paul Rand’s logos for \nUPS, Westinghouse, and Cummins were all \nredesigns. In each case Rand’s genius was \nfinding a way to maintain elements from the \noriginal identity and transform them into bigger \nideas and stronger, more sustainable visual \nforms. His strategy was always to present one \nidea. His brilliant design sensibility was matched \nby his strategic presentations, in which he traced \nthe evolution of his recommendation.\nWe never know what the process will reveal.\nHans-U.

You design for dura-\nbility, for function, for usefulness, for rightness, for \nbeauty. But permanence is up to God and time.”\nPer Mollerup  \nIdentification, description, and the creation of value \nare just some of the possible functions of a \ntrademark.\nHans-U. Allemann \nWe usually begin with very predictable and obvious \nideas, but the beauty of the identity design process \nis that it is totally unpredictable. We never know \nwhat the process will reveal. I have been designing \nmarks for forty years, and the process still aston-\nishes me.\nSteff Geissbuhler \nThe trademark, although a most important element, \ncan never tell the whole story. At best it conveys \none or two notions or aspects of the business. The \nidentity has to be supported by a visual language \nand a vocabulary.\nMalcolm Grear \nForm and counterform. Light and tension. Expanded \nmeaning that is not exhausted at first glance. You \nneed to know the enterprise inside and out.\nPaula Scher\nMy best idea is always my first idea. It took me a \nfew seconds to draw it, but it took me thirty-four \nyears to learn how to draw it in a few seconds.\nLouise Fili\nA logo is a typographic portrait—the face of a busi-\nness. I talk to clients at length, learning everything \nabout who they are and what is important to them, \nand then translate that into type. A great logo \nappears effortless—and is, of course, anything but. \nBart Crosby\nA logotype or a symbol should express the funda-\nmental essence of an organization or a product or a \nservice—the visual manifestation of its nature, its \naspirations, its culture, its reason for being.\nDavid Airey\nTo be a good designer you must be curious about \nlife. The strongest ideas are born from the experi-\nences we have and the knowledge we gain from \nthem.\nChermayeff & Geismar\nWe are looking for the most direct connection \nbetween an idea and the creation of a form. \nSagi Haviv\nIdentity design is not about what one likes or dis-\nlikes. It’s about what works.\nThe best identity  \ndesigners have a strong \nunderstanding of how to \ncommunicate effectively \nthrough the use of signs \nand symbols, a keen sense \nof form and letterforms, \nand an understanding of \nthe history of design.\nHans-U.

Frequently, a logotype is juxtaposed \nwith a symbol in a formal relationship called the \nsignature. Logotypes need to be not only dis­\ntinctive, but durable and sustainable. Legibility  \nat various scales and in a range of media is \nimperative, whether a logotype is silk-­screened \non the side of a ballpoint pen or illuminated in  \nan external sign twenty stories off the ground. \nThe best logotypes are a result of careful typo-\ngraphic exploration. Designers consider the  \nattributes of each letterform, as well as the rela-\ntionships between letterforms. In the best \nlogotypes, letterforms may be redrawn, modified, \nand manipulated in order to express the  \nappropriate personality and positioning of  \nthe company.\nThe designer begins his or her process by exam-\nining hundreds of typographic variations. \nBegin­ning with the basics—for example, whether \nthe name should be set in all caps or caps and \nlowercase—the designer proceeds to look at \nclassic and modern typefaces, roman and italic \nvariations, and various weights, scales, and com-\nbinations. The designer then proceeds to \nmanipulate and customize the logotype. Each \ndecision is driven by visual and performance con-\nsiderations, as well as by what the typography \nitself communicates.\nA signature is the specific and nonnegotiable \ndesigned combination of the brandmark and the \nlogotype.

In Korea you show \nrespect for a colleague by presenting a business \ncard in two hands. In the Far East most corpo-\nrate business cards are two-­sided, with one side, \nfor example, in Korean, and the other side in \nEnglish. The Western-­size business card is \nslowly becoming the standard around the world, \nalthough many countries still use variations of  \na larger card.\nIn the nineteenth century, Victorian calling cards \nwere elaborately decorated, oversized designs to  \nshowcase a name. Today the designer is faced \nwith so much information to include—from email \nto voicemail to mobile phone and 800 numbers, \ndouble addresses and domains—that the small \nbusiness card is a challenge even for the most \nexperienced designers. Information, by necessity, \nis flowing to the back side.\nThe business card is a small and portable mar-\nketing tool. The quality and intelligence of the \ninformation are a reflection of the cardholder \nand her company. In the future a high-­tech  \nbusiness card may double as an identification \ncard and include a user’s fingerprint or other bio-\nmetric data.\nMexico Restaurante y Barra: AdamsMorioka\nA good business card is like a kick-ass tie; it  \nwon’t make you a better person, but it’ll get you  \nsome respect.\nSean Adams \nPartner, AdamsMorioka",

It is a competitive \nadvantage. \nPositioning relative to the competition and \nto the other members of the product line is \ncritical for developing a packaging strategy. \nA disciplined, coherent approach leads to a \nunified, powerful brand presence. \nStructure and graphics can be developed \nconcurrently. It is a chicken-and-egg debate. \nBrand extensions are always a strategic \ntug-of-war between differentiation and \ncoherence within a product line. \nConsider the entire life cycle of the package \nand its relationship to the product: source, \nprint, assemble, pack, preserve, ship, display, \npurchase, use, recycle/dispose. \nDevise timetables involving packaging \napproval and production, sales force \nmeetings, product sell in to stores, \nmanufacturing, and distribution. \nDeveloping a new structure takes a long \ntime and is very expensive, but it offers a \nunique competitive advantage.",

Traditionally the CEO and the mar-\nketing department were the most visible brand \nchampions—individuals who understood and \ncould articulate a company’s core values, vision, \nand brand essence. \nCompanies all around the world are beginning  \nto develop compelling ways of sharing the brand \nessence—from road shows, to online branding \ntools and guides, to special events.

Unlike traditional  \n“Brand 101” classes, it focuses not just on \neducation, but on creating employee \nengagement and ambassadorship. The module \nuses an assortment of creative and interactive  \nexamples to help illustrate the value of  \nintangible properties such as reputation and \ntrust; for instance, inviting the audience to \nimagine the customer experience of a Deloitte-\nbranded airline. Taken in over 100 countries,  \nthe module has helped shape a network of \nchampions with a deeper understanding of the \npower of brand. \nZappos.com Culture Book\nEach year, Tony Hsieh, CEO, Zappos.com,  \nsends an email to all employees, partners, and \nvendors, asking them to write a few paragraphs \nabout what the culture means to them. The \nsubmissions are unedited, except for typos, \nbecause one of the company’s core values is to \nbuild “open and honest relationships with \ncommunication.” The number one priority at \nZappos is the company culture. Zappos's core \nvalues are embedded within every touchpoint, \nincluding in how the company hires, trains, and \ndevelops employees. The culture and the brand \nare viewed as “two sides of the same coin.” Each \nyear, Zappos publishes a full-color culture book \nfilled with photos and what everyone wrote about \nwhat the culture means to them. It has become \nan annual tradition. The 2010 book was 304 \npages and printed on recycled paper using soy \ninks.\nARAMARK and the road show \nPublic companies routinely use road shows  \nto bring their messages directly to key investors \nand analysts. Road shows are also an effective \ntactic for launching brand initiatives. ARAMARK \nchairman and CEO Joe Neubauer traveled  \nto seven cities to speak to 5,000 frontline \nmanagers to launch his company’s new  \nbrand and to align employees with the vision  \nof the company. “If employees are excited and \nmobilized, then more than half the branding \nbattle has been won,” said Bruce Berkowitz, \nformer director of advertising for ARAMARK. \n“Employees carry the company’s culture and \ncharacter into the marketplace.” \nARAMARK worked with a meeting planning \ncompany to produce a one-­hour road show.  \nThe show included a skit performed by \nBroadway actors and a multimedia  \npresentation of the political, cultural, and \neconomic milestones that gave a context for  \nthe company’s metamorphosis. Neubauer \nreinforced key messages about the company’s \nheritage and its leadership in the industry. His \noverarching message, “Employees are the heart \nof our success and convey our company’s top-­\ntier delivery of services,” was supported by a new \nbrandmark. Designed by the Schechter Group \n(now part of Interbrand), the mark embodies the \nstar quality of the employees and supports the \nnew brand promise of “managed services, \nmanaged better.” \nManagers were fully prepped on the new brand \nvision and strategy. They received an “Ambas­\nsador’s Kit” that contained a company history, \ncopies of the new advertising campaign, a \nmerchandise catalog, and a graphic standards  \nmanual. In addition, the materials included a \nmanager’s checklist and a media launch \nschedule with explicit instructions on how to \nhandle the launch, how to explain it to staff \nmembers, and how to implement the brand \nidentity change. The CEO’s presence and \npassion combined with accessible brand-­ \nbuilding tools were a powerful combination  \nthat fueled ARAMARK’s growth.\nZappos Core Values\nDeliver WOW through \nservice.\nEmbrace and drive change.\nCreate fun and a little \nweirdness.\nBe adventurous, creative,  \nand open-minded.\nPursue growth and learning.\nBuild open and honest \nrelationships with \ncommunication.\nBuild a positive team and \nfamily spirit.\nDo more with less.\nBe passionate and \ndetermined.\nBe humbled.",

Because they are based on \nmathematically defined lines and \ncurves, they can be manipulated \nand scaled without losing repro-\nduction quality.\nEPS Encapsulated PostScript\nRaster or bitmap images\nRaster or bitmap images are \ncontinuous-­tone images that are \nconstructed as a continuous \nmapping of pixels. These images \ncannot be scaled, rotated, or \nskewed outside of an image-­\nediting application without the \nloss of reproduction quality.\nResolution\nThe resolution of digital imagery is measured in pixels per inch \n(ppi), the digital equivalent of dots per inch (dpi). The end use \nof the image is critical for determining the optimum resolution.\nFor printing, the higher the resolution the more detail and \nclarity there is to the image, and the larger the file is in terms \nof memory. Offset printing typically requires 300 ppi resolution.\nFor screen display, the pixels in the image map directly to the \npixels on the screen. Images for screen display should be 72 \nppi (Mac) or 96 ppi (PC), but the physical dimensions will be \naffected by the resolution of the display itself. \nFile naming conventions\nFile names should have no more than fifteen characters plus a \nthree-letter file extension (.eps, .jpg, .gif, .doc) indicating what \ntype of file it is.\nDo not use uppercase, spaces, or special characters, such as \n“\\ / : * < > ? ¦. Use a period only before the file extension \nsuffix.\nCreate a system for organizing and identifying those variations \nof the artwork that are required for different applications, such \nas signature, color, sub-brand entity, and file format.\nVector graphics created in a \ndrawing program are saved or \nexported as EPS files so that they \ncan be placed into other \napplications.\nThe highest-quality output for \ngraphic images with hard edges. \nPrinters must have Adobe® \nPostScript®.\nWhen vector graphics are saved \nas TIF, JPG, or other bitmap file \nformat, the hard-edged lines and \ncurves are converted to pixels.\nEPS files created in Adobe \nPhotoshop® are bitmap images \nand will lose clarity when scaled \nor printed.\nTIF Tag Image File Format\nHighest-quality output for \nphotographic images\nBest bitmap version of hard-\nedged graphics—alternative to \nEPS when an Adobe® \nPostScript® printer is unavailable\nConvenient for exchanging image \nfiles between computer platforms \nJPG Joint Photographic \nExperts Group\nCompressed file format for \non-screen viewing of continuous-\ntone photographs\nCompression adds “artifacts” and \nsmears text, lines, and edges\nNot suitable for printing\nGIF Graphics Interchange \nFormat\nCompressed file format for \non-screen viewing of graphics and \nimages in HTML\nNot suitable for printing\nPNG Portable Network Graphic\nFile Format Matrix\t\nPhotographic images \nwith continuous tone\nGraphic images with \nhard edges\nPrinting\t\nDesign software\t\nTIF\t\n   EPS\n\t\n\u0007Adobe Illustrator®, Adobe Photoshop®  \nCorelDRAW®, QuarkXpress®, Adobe InDesign®\n\t\nOffice software\t\nTIF\t\n   TIF (PNG)\n\t\nMicrosoft Word®, Microsoft Excel®\t\n\t\nConverts vector graphics to bitmap image\nScreen\t\nDesign software\t\nJPG\t\n   GIF (PNG, TIF)\n\t\nAdobe ImageReady®, among others \n\t\nOffice software\t\nJPG\t\n   TIF (PNG)\n\t\nPowerPoint®\nThese are just a few of \nthe most widely used \nformats.",

ACHC \nexecutives worked collaboratively to substantiate \nhow Iñupiat values shape the way ACHC and its \nsubsidiaries conduct business. There was unilat-\neral agreement that the brand architecture needed \nto support and clearly communicate the fact that \nACHC and the six subsidiaries work together as a \nunified team to provide unique efficiencies and \nvalue. It became clear that the final identity system \nhad to communicate that each of the companies \nwas part of something larger. A unified naming \nconvention was developed to convey brand \nstrength and support future growth through \nmergers and acquisitions. The ACHC Family of \nCompanies was born, and became the platform for \nthe creative process.\nCreative solution: Salminen designed a simple \nand bold brandmark that forms a shield around a \nbowhead whale tail. The bowhead is regarded as \nthe longest-­living mammal and lives exclusively  \nin the Arctic. In the Iñupiat culture, the bowhead \nwhale is a powerful symbol of community, cooper-\nation, fairness, integrity, leadership, respect, and \nteamwork, which are the values of the ACHC \nFamily of Companies. The white curve and lower \nshape represent the vast Arctic horizon. The brand \narchitecture system positions the companies as \none unified entity, and embraces cultural heritage. \nThe parent company and subsidiaries each have \none predominant designated color. The color pal-\nette was crafted to speak directly to the \ngeographical location of the Iñupiat people, with \ncolor names such as Bowhead Gray, Baleen Black, \nIce Blue, and Wetland Green. In addition to devel-\noping identity standards, Salminen designed \ncollateral materials, signage, magazine ads, \napparel, field gear, and seven websites.\nResults: The new identity and brand architecture \nsystem has made it easier for existing clients and \nprospects to understand that each of the ACHC \ncompanies has a unique focus in the construction \nindustry, and leverages the full technical, logistical, \nand personnel resources of the entire organiza-\ntion. To launch the brand internally, each employee \nwas presented with a stylish coffee tumbler, a \nwater bottle, and an invitation to experience the \nnewly launched websites. An unanticipated benefit \nof the process was a proud workplace and a \nrenewed internal energy. \nThe strategic process was  \nthe core foundation and  \nmain driver that helped  \neveryone involved make \ninformed design decisions.\nSini Salminen\nDesigner and Brand Consultant\nACHC: Sini Salminen\n213",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: The ACLU set out to \nreach a broader constituency and build member-\nship, and asked Fo Wilson Group to customize a \nteam to build a unified, meaningful identity. The Fo \nWilson Group, a design consultancy, was joined by \nSylvia Harris, an information design strategist, and \nMichael Hirschhorn, an organizational dynamics \nexpert. In the audit, the team found more than fifty \nlogos. Every state affiliate had its own logo, \nwebsite design, and architecture, with little con-\nnection to the national organization. Other \nadvocacy organizations were studied, and Harris \nfound that the “ACLU represents a set of princi-\nples, while most other advocacy groups represent \na constituency.” The team interviewed a wide \nrange of stakeholders, including affiliates, commu-\nnications staff, and members. The most frequently \nmentioned attribute that defined the ACLU was \n“principled,” followed by “justice” and “guardian.” A \nsurvey conducted in 2000 by Belden, Russonello \n& Stewart found that “over 8 out of 10 Americans \n(85%) had heard of the ACLU.” The team realized \nthat the ACLU identity needed to be recognized in \na wide variety of arenas, from town halls to court-\nrooms and campuses.\nCreative solution: The design directive was to \ncapitalize on a highly recognizable acronym, and to \nconnect ACLU principles and the spirit of freedom \nto the acronym. Fo Wilson Group designed a \nseries of signatures with a contemporary logotype \nand expressive symbolism. Several options were \ntested for the modular system that used patriotic \nimagery. During the audit, the team found that the \nACLU’s original symbol from the 1930s was the \nStatue of Liberty, and it had been dropped in the \n1980s. The Statue of Liberty tested the best, and \nalthough other advocacy groups used the symbol, \nthe ACLU decided to return to its legacy and his-\ntory. A unique photographic perspective of the \nstatue’s face was stylized, and a photographic sig-\nnature was adopted to work in the digital \nenvironment. A range of applications demon-\nstrated how the system worked, from website \narchitecture to newsletters and membership cards. \nThe flexible system needed to work for the \nnational office, the affiliates, the foundations, and \nspecial projects.\nResults: The ACLU’s leadership group \nchampioned the identity initiative from the early \nplanning through the analysis, decision making, \nand rollout. The identity team conducted a series \nof phone conference presentations to the \naffiliates. Educational programs for staff were \nconducted at the headquarters. The group was \ninstrumental in getting forty-­nine of the fifty \naffiliates to adopt the new identity system. The \nnational organization paid to have new letterhead \nprinted for the affiliates. Opto Design was retained \nto finalize the design system, produce all the \npreliminary applications, and develop an ACLU \nIdentity Guidelines website. ACLU membership \ngrew from 400,000 to 550,000 members; the \norganization attributes this growth to its “Keep \nAmerica Safe and Free” campaign that challenged \ngovernment policies proposed in the aftermath of \n9/11 that would limit freedom.\nFoundation identity\nAffiliate identity\nNational identity\nWith a complex national \norganizational model such as \nthe ACLU, it is important to \nstrategize thoughtfully how to \ngather input, test out ideas, and \nroll out new plans across the \n50+ offices nationally.\nMichael Hirschhorn\nOrganizational Dynamics Expert\nAlthough the ACLU had \nhistorically been strong           \nin media relations, \ncommunications was a new \nfunction that was needed.\nEmily Tynes\nCommunications Director\nACLU\nThe challenge was to develop \nan identity that could operate in \nmultiple arenas and for multiple \nconstituents simultaneously.\nFo Wilson\nDesigner and Educator\n215",

Adobe wanted \nto inspire designers and other professional users \nto adopt Adobe® Digital Publishing Suite (DPS). \nAdobe’s strategy was to provide a free quarterly \napp that would make it easy to learn new tools \nthrough experimentation and play. Adobe engaged \nMarcolina Slate, a firm with advanced experience \nin DPS, to design a branding framework that \nwould engage users, accelerate learning, and build \ncommunity. Adobe identified leaders within its user \ncommunity to both create initial submission mate-\nrials and encourage broader community \nparticipation. Marcolina visualized a whimsical \n“swap meet” atmosphere, and created a series of \neasy-to-use templates in Adobe InDesign that art-\nists could populate with their content and at the \nsame time explore DPS. It would also put their \nwork and name in front of the large Adobe user \ncommunity by giving them means to share tuto-\nrials of their creation on the topics of imaging, \nvideo, web, and design in free downloadable \nissues on iTunes.\nCreative solution: How do you create a commu-\nnity app that offers a rewarding, fun, and \neducational experience for community members, \nin order to encourage participation? Technically, \nMarcolina wanted it to showcase the best interac-\ntive possibilities available in an easy-to-use \nInDesign package. iTunes browsers can see and \ndownload the most recent issue. There are four \ndifferent branded covers for Digital Imaging, Video, \nWeb, and Design. For the tutorial authors \nMarcolina created five distinct templates, each \ndependent on the skill level or type of tutorial \n(video versus web) being built. As an incentive, \nthere are also three profile templates where the \nartists can tell their story or show a larger array of \nwork to the world. Since creating an interactive \ntablet document in InDesign is new and somewhat \ncomplex, Marcolina built pre-rigged template \nassets that allowed newcomers to add content in \na step-by-step manner with detailed instructions \nand tutorial links with every template. \nResults: In July, the Community Publishing App \nwas launched on iTunes and many contributing \nauthors have begun to experience the excitement \nof digital publishing with DPS. Cross-promotions \nappeared on Adobe blogs, social media, and \nforums. Marketing extended to partner sites, user \ngroups, Adobe Community Professionals, AIGA, \ndesign schools, art organizations, and current DPS \nusers.

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: Palmer West and Jonah \nSmith, Los Angeles-­based film producers, created \nAether Apparel to fill a gap in the market. As out-\ndoor sport enthusiasts, they found that most \nperformance-­driven apparel companies lacked  \ndesign or style, and most fashion lines did not  \nfeature technical advancements in outerwear. \nTheir target market was the discerning customer \nwho appreciated high-­style, high-­quality, high-­\nperformance clothing and wanted to show it, both \non the streets of Manhattan and on the ski slopes \nof Park City. They engaged Carbone Smolan \nAgency (CSA) to design a brand platform and \nwebsite that would elevate the company from \nstart-­up to established luxury brand. The founders \nnamed their company Aether, meaning “upper air,” \na reference to the air that Greek gods breathed on \nOlympus. In extensive interviews, CSA found that \nthe core brand message was focused on style, \nfunction, and a surprisingly simple promise from \nthe founders, “If we personally do not want  \nto wear it, we will not make it.”\nCreative solution: CSA designed a mark based \non the Aether A to evoke clouds swirling around a \nmountain peak. The iconic mark and logotype \nwere designed to reflect the simple aesthetic of \nthe clothes themselves. “The white logotype on \nblack epitomizes the striking yet minimalist quality \nof the garments and provides just enough ‘urban \ncool’ to stand out in a market filled with excess,” \nsays Ken Carbone. The full system of brand appli-\ncations included clothing labels, hangtags, ads, \nlook books, and an e-­commerce website. The \nbrand comes to life on the website, where dra-\nmatic and evocative environmental photography \ntransports the viewer to the road to nowhere and \neverywhere, setting the mood for beauty, adven-\nture, and mystery. The website itself has a clear \nstructure for easily viewing products, which are  \nimpeccably photographed. Product names like \nAtmosphere, Flatlands, and Space appeal to a  \nnew generation of world adventure travelers that \nare as comfortable rock climbing on a glacier as \nthey are bar hopping in Soho.\nResults: Aether Apparel is actively growing and \nbreaking into new markets and new marketing \nchannels. Their year-to-year growth is in the triple \ndigits, the expanding product line includes wom-\nen’s wear and swimwear, and their retail presence \nhas gone from web-only to selling products at \nJ.Crew.

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: In 1999 Amazon.com  \nretained Turner Duckworth to redesign its brand \nidentity. Amazon.com’s positioning as a customer-­\nfocused, friendly company was the core of its  \nmission and values. The challenge was to create  \na unique and proprietary identity that maintained \nwhat Amazon.com believed were its brand equi-\nties: lowercase type in the logo, and an orange \nswoosh underneath the name. Turner Duckworth \nimmersed itself in the brand, spent a lot of time on \nthe website, and examined competitor sites. The \nfirm also analyzed what makes a logo effective or \nineffective on the web. “Our goal was to infuse \npersonality into the logo, and to create a compel-\nling idea that would convey the brand message,” \nsaid David Turner, head of design.\nCreative solution: The design team developed \ndistinct visual strategies at the first stage; each \none emphasized a different aspect of the posi-\ntioning brief. The final logo design was an \nevolutionary leap from the old logo. The central \nidea behind the new logo reflected the client’s \nbusiness strategy of selling more than just books. \nThe design team connected the initial a of \n“amazon” to the z. This approach clearly communi-\ncated “Amazon.com sells everything from A to Z.” \nThe graphic device that connects the a and the z \nalso speaks to the brand positioning: customer \nfocus and friendly service. This device forms a \ncheeky smile with a dimple that pushes up the z. \nThe brown shipper box packaging was considered \nat every stage of the logo design. Turner \nDuckworth designed custom lettering for the \nwordmark and made the “amazon” more prominent \nthan the “.com.” The typography was designed to \ngive the logo a friendlier and unique look. The \ndesign team also designed a full alphabet so that \nAmazon.com could update its inter­national \ndomains, currently in the United Kingdom, \nGermany, France, and Japan.

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: In 2005, the Russian  \nmobile communications market was approaching \nsaturation, especially in Moscow. The principal \nplayers were competing for the leading position in \nthe market and there was no clear point of differ-\nentiation between them. The competitive audit \nrevealed that marketing and branding in the \nmobile communications sector was focused \nmostly on technology rather than people. Wolff \nOlins was engaged to create a new brand identity \nthat would build an emotional bond with con-\nsumers in order to retain loyalty. The other \nprerequisite for the new brand was to provide an \noutward-­looking, more modern face that would \nhelp the company prepare for regional and inter-\nnational expansion. The competitive audit also \nrevealed that the market in general was cluttered \nand noisy. The opportunity for Wolff Olins was \nclear—create a brand that could stand out and cut \nthrough the noise. The brand team worked closely \nwith Beeline’s marketing team in Moscow to \ndeliver a brand that was bold and that delivered \nmaximum impact.\nCreative solution: Inspired by the company’s \nstrategy, Wolff Olins developed a working platform \nto focus the work. “Beeline inspires me to live  \nlife to the fullest” was the idea used to drive all  \naspects of the creative work, both visually and ton-\nally. The solution was not just a logo but a \ncomplete and coherent language that was flexible \nand universal, that captured the imagination of dif-\nferent audiences across Russia and that \ntranscended cultural and social barriers. Visually, it \nwas an invitation to see life with imagination, illus-\ntrated by the use of black and yellow stripes in an \nindividual and ownable way. The new tagline, “Live \non the bright side”, informed the tone for the new \nbrand’s personality. Brightness, friendliness, sim-\nplicity, and positive emotions would be the new \nattributes of the revitalized brand. A new brand \nidentity system, communications style guidelines, \nand an image library were created to get the com-\npany ready for the launch. Wolff Olins was also \ncommissioned to create the launch campaign.\nResults: The rebrand was a great success. At  \nthe end of 2005 revenue was up by 40 percent, \nmarket capitalization by 28 percent, and average \nrevenue per user by 7 percent. Wolff Olins con-\ntinues to work with Beeline as it grows into new \nregions and product areas. Since relaunching the \nbrand, Beeline has been inde­pendently ranked the \nmost valuable brand in Russia for three consecu-\ntive years, according to Interbrand Zintzmeyer & \nLux in Business Week. \n223",

The John Deere Foundation sup-\nports initiatives in education, the environment, and \ncommunity development. The Bela União school \nensures that the children in Horizontina, a small \nrural town in southern Brazil, have a place to learn \nand to go when their parents are working. Bela \nUnião means beautiful union in Portuguese, which \nis the native language of Brazil. The teachers \nbelieved that the school should have a logo  \nso they drew one. In May 2011, the John Deere \nFoundation decided to engage the Criativia  \nBrand Studio to design a simple identity for the \nschool that that conveyed a feeling about the \nschool, and “Planting social responsibility. \nHarvesting citizenship.“\nCreative solution: Criativia decided to emphasize \nthe most characteristic sentiment of the Latin \nAmerican people—love. “Love is the way that we \nmake dreams come true. Love is what we feel \nwhen we know that our children have a brighter \nperspective for their future, “ said Ricardo \nSalvador, director of Criativia. After exploring a \nrange of possibilities, Criativia decided that the \nbest image would be a heart—not just any heart, \nbut one that could represent simplicity and at the \nsame time the letter B from the word “Bela”. So \nthey drew a continuous line to combine those two \nideas in one unique symbol. The color red was \nchosen because of its strong connotation to love. \nThe typeface and the lettering were designed to \nwork with the symbol, maintaining its simplicity \nand meaning. The entire logo works well in gray \nscale or in black and white since maintains its legi-\nbility, and that’s important for a school that can’t \nalways print in color.\nResults: Today, when the inhabitants of \nHorizontina see children wearing t-shirts with  \na heart in the shape of the letter B they know  \nthat those children are safe from the streets  \nand on their way to a better future. The children \nwear the school T-shirts each day like a school \nuniform.

As a result, \nthe neighborhood is strengthened and kids experi-\nence the joy of earning and owning a bike. In 2011, \nthe shop was a beneficiary of Matchstic’s annual \npro bono branding project, On The House. \nMatchstic and other partner companies joined \ntogether to increase the shop’s efforts to impact \nthe city of Atlanta, all free of charge. Matchstic \nbegan the process by developing a brand brief, \npositioning the shop’s unique approach to commu-\nnity development through “Kids Earning Bikes.” \nMatchstic developed a visual program that clearly \ncommunicated the story across all critical \ntouchpoints to garner the support and respect of \ncommunity members and encourage bike enthusi-\nasts to get involved. \nCreative solution: “Matchstic’s design encapsu-\nlates everything the bike shop is: kid-friendly \nwithout being childish, hopeful, and a little gritty. It \nspeaks to the coming together of a community \nwith the goal of building strong neighborhoods \nwhere kids can grow up,” says director Tim O’Mara. \nThe bold, yellow mark features a stylized illustra-\ntion of a bicycle; two wrenches—the most \ncommonly used tools in the shop—form the bicy-\ncle’s tires.

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: In fall 2008, the California \nAcademy of Sciences unveiled its iconic new \nbuilding that exists beneath a 2.5-­acre living roof. \nThe $488 million all-­green, LEED Platinum \nCertified museum was designed by Renzo Piano. \nPentagram was engaged to design an identity and \nvisual system that celebrates the Academy’s \ndynamic, thriving, and interconnected experience, \nand complements its state-­of-­the-art facilities. The \ncomprehensive identity system needed to include \ncollateral, development, and membership mate-\nrials; interior and exterior signs, banners, and \ndonor walls; newsletters, membership cards, and \nvisitor maps; and more. Pentagram’s Kit Hinrichs \nand Laura Scott worked closely with the \nAcademy’s senior leadership team, building archi-\ntects, and other design consultants, to create a \ncohesive brand experience to increase recogni-\ntion, visitation, membership, and support.\nCreative solution: Taking inspiration from the \nbuilding’s architecture, the Academy’s new identity \nreinforces the cyclical nature of the natural sci-\nences, and is often described as “The Fabric  \nof Life.” Everything was designed to have an  \nunexpected element of discovery and engage-\nment—like a photograph with a twist or scale \nlarger than life, or the twenty-one-foot diameter \nlogo at the entryway inset into the ground so chil-\ndren can trace its outline with their feet. For the \ndevelopment newsletters, the theme “Life Stories” \nwas created; oversized newsletters bring to life \nstories of people who have infused their passion \ninto or been impassioned by the Academy, be they \nstaff, donors, docents, enthusiasts, volunteers, \nresearchers, scientists, aspiring scientists, or wide-­\neyed kids. Pentagram also created a series of \ndonor walls. The major donor wall is a permanent \ninstallation of 388 six-­inch-­square glass blocks, a \nmodern take on scientific “specimen boxes” that \nhave been etched with names of major contribu-\ntors. True to its sustainability mission, every \nelement is designed with environmental responsi-\nbility in mind; membership cards are printed on \nrecycled plastic and issued for the lifetime of the \nmember, and visitor maps are printed on recycled \npaper and designed to be reused.\nResults: The new California Academy of Sciences \nhas been met with unprecedented local, national, \nand international enthusiasm. Membership has \ngrown to over 75,000 in the first six months (up \nfrom 16,000 in 2004 when the Academy closed \nfor reconstruction). Attendance has far exceeded \nits ambitious opening goals and, just five months \nafter the opening, the Academy celebrated its \none-­millionth visitor.\nDonor wall\nPhotos: Tim Griffith\nCalifornia Academy of Sciences: Pentagram\n229",

The Carbone Smolan \nAgency (CSA) was engaged to envision the best \nway to bring Carnegie’s robust product line and \nexpertise online, and to amplify Carnegie’s status \nas a premier design brand. How could a website \nmake it easier for interior designers, architects, \nand facility managers to choose from hundreds  \nof offerings? CSA determined that Carnegie’s \nhigh-quality service, ease of browsing, and range \nof choices needed to be conveyed as fluently \nonline as it was in the company’s brick-and-mortar \nshowrooms. CSA led focus groups of designers \nand buyers to gain insights into unmet needs, \nchallenges, and optimal workflow. The sales team \nsought a solution that highlighted superior cus-\ntomer service and integrity. The buyers \ndiagrammed their work process, and CSA simpli-\nfied the matrix of the multitude of choices.\nCreative solution: CSA created an online show-\nroom to integrate customer needs with Carnegie’s \nofferings. Accessibility was the guiding force in \nthe design, simplifying Carnegie’s extensive selec-\ntion through an intuitive interface with detailed \ncategorization, accessible navigation menus, and \nheightened search functionality. The site works  \nby mirroring the way clients like to search, allowing \nthem to browse, navigate, and sort Carnegie’s  \ncollections: first by selecting use, then color, price, \npatterns, and other customizable options. One  \nof the key technological enhancements is a  \nrendering section that allows designers to immedi-\nately see how their chosen upholstery, wall \ncovering, or drapery options will look in a space. To \nfurther enhance the new website, CSA refreshed \nthe existing identity by incorporating a bold color \npalette and designing a multicolored, dynamic ver-\nsion of the existing logo to be used as a “billboard” \non the site’s home page. The identity treatment \ndrives a coordinated advertising campaign to \nlaunch the new online showroom and the rest of \nCarnegie’s marketing communications.\nResults: The new website distinguishes Carnegie \nas a leader in the textile marketplace. The ren-\ndering section and the simplified sample ordering \nsystem were publicized as industry game \nchangers. Since the site launched, monthly visits \nand the number of clients using online accounts  \nhave grown, and Carnegie has seen a 6 percent \nincrease in online sample orders. The richness  \nof the site as a marketing resource replaces the \nneed for printed marketing materials, cementing \nCarnegie’s status as an eco-­friendly company.\nCarnegie: Carbone Smolan Agency\n231",

Surrounded by \nmountains and rivers, the city has a lively culture of \nentrepreneurship, a burgeoning design community, \nand an eclectic music scene. De Villiers, originally \nfrom South Africa, now calls Chattanooga his \nhome. Dooley moved to Chattanooga after years \nof travel. Both typographers have designed fonts \nfor big brands like Nike and GE. Being two of \nsome 300 professional typeface designers glob-\nally, they had the expertise and experience to \nexecute their vision. The typographers decided to \njoin forces with brand consultants and business \npartners DJ Trischler and Jonathan Mansfield from \nD+J Identity to set a plan and launch a campaign. \nThey all believed that Chattanooga, a municipality \nwith a population of 500,000, was at the right \ndevelopmental stage to adopt and embrace a \nstrong, citywide visual identity. \nCreative solution: While Dooley and de Villiers \ncontinued developing the typeface, D+J began \nefforts to introduce the initiative to the larger com-\nmunity. The typeface designers consulted historian \nDean Arnold to consider influences from \nChattanooga’s past, and reflected on the city’s \nmodern industrial identity. The team presented the \nidea at an event. The four team members had \nagreed that Kickstarter, a project crowd-funding \nsite, would be the right vehicle to promote and \nraise support for the effort. Kickstarter allows \nteams to set a fundraising goal for creative proj-\nects and post a video explaining the project and \nwhy it deserves funding. Mansfield and Trischler \nplanned, filmed, edited, and produced the \nKickstarter video, which featured local creatives \nand used design and writing skills to communicate \nand highlight the work. \nResults: The Kickstarter goal was exceeded.

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: Coca-Cola is the most \nvaluable and recognized brand in the world. Its \ntrademark and contour bottle design are ubiqui-\ntous cultural icons. In late 2005, Coca-Cola North \nAmerica engaged Turner Duckworth with the \ndesign goal of making the brand feel happy, fresh, \nand honest. The process began with analyzing \nCoca-Cola’s heritage and visual assets, and dem-\nonstrating how leadership brands use design and \nvisual identity to achieve a competitive advantage. \nThere was agreement that Coca-Cola’s identity \nhad become cluttered, uninspiring, and static. \nGiven the rapid pace of change in today’s con-\nsumer society, the team felt that Coca-Cola’s \nidentity needed to be dynamic and constantly \nrelevant to the culture. Turner Duckworth identified \nfive principles of iconic brands to guide the design \nthinking against the brand idea “Coke brings joy.”\nCreative solution: Turner Duckworth focused on \nCoca-Cola’s iconic elements that no other brand \ncan own: the white Spencerian script on a red \nbackground, the trademark contour bottle, and the \ndynamic ribbon. Turner Duckworth showed what \nthe design of “Coke brings joy” looks like and feels \nlike across multiple touchpoints, from cups to \ntrucks to environments. Turner Duckworth exam-\nined the entire visual identity toolbox: trademarks, \nicons, color, scale, symbols, patterns, forms, typog-\nraphy, and photography. At various stages of the \nprocess, designs were sent into research to verify \nthat they were aligned with company strategy. The \nnew bold and simple design strategy leveraged \nthe trademark’s enduring and emotional appeal. \nThe design has the simplicity, confidence, and flex-\nibility to work in different environments and media. \nIt was designed to be in tune with the culture.

Its mission is to bring the Deloitte brand to \nlife, and build brand eminence with practitioners, \nclients, and communities around the world. \nExternal research substantiated the need to shift \nthe perception of Deloitte as just a Big Four \naccounting and tax firm to that of a professional \nprovider with a diversified, multi-­functional service \noffering. In 2008, the team examined strategies \nbased on three core brand attributes: anticipation, \nrelentlessness, and pragmatism. The new posi-\ntioning platform, Always One Step Ahead, was \nenvisioned to radically differentiate Deloitte from \nits leading competitors by creating a category of \none. This internal platform needed a strong \nexternal form of expression to spark recognition \nacross media, and resonate in numerous global \nmarketplaces and cultures. The independent \nmember firms were introduced to the new, \norganization-­wide call to action, and the Global \nBrand team began a process to leverage local \ninsights and expertise to determine the most \neffective implementation.\nCreative solution: The global brand team worked \nwith two agencies, The Partners and Muir Howard, \nto develop a dynamic and timeless visual lan-\nguage. Following more than six months of \ndevelopment and intensive collaboration, the \n“green dot campaign” was launched. The green \ndot, a signature element of the Deloitte logo, was \nthe inspiration. This solitary, large iconic green dot \nbecame the focus of a creative and brand centric \nmultichannel communication strategy. Although \nthere can only be one green dot in any visual, the \nmessaging possibilities proved to be infinite. A \nrange of treatments was conceptualized to  \ndemonstrate the flexibility, power, and latitude of \nthe system, and a “green dot toolbox,” containing \nsample ads and design guidelines for consistency \nin look, feel, and messaging was developed. All  \nassets were housed on Brand Space, Deloitte’s \nglobal brand content management system, for \neasy access by all Deloitte member firm profes-\nsionals and approved vendors.\nResults: In 2010, Deloitte became the largest \nprofessional services firm in the world. Despite  \na decentralized structure, member firms have real-\nized the value of a consistently applied brand  \ntoward achieving key strategic objectives. The \ncampaign’s bold visual style and provocative mes-\nsaging has accelerated marketplace recognition, \nand has paid dividends inside the organization  \nas well. In the first and largest brand engagement \nprogram of its kind, 182,000 employees were \nasked to create their own green dot ad concepts, \ncrafting a unique and authentic brand experience.\nOur brand positioning informs \neverything we do—from internal \ntalent initiatives to external \ncommunications campaigns. It \nis a unifying idea which serves \nto clarify, align, and elevate.\nBrian Resnick\nGlobal Brand & Visual Identity Leader\nDeloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited\n237",

Labbrand, a brand \nconsultancy headquartered in Shanghai, was \nengaged to create the English and Chinese brand \nnames and to design the visual identity system. \nThe brand naming methodology started with the \ndevelopment of a creative brief, followed by sev-\neral rounds of brainstorming as well as software \ngeneration to come up with thousands of potential \nname candidates. After an initial selection, a smart \nlegal check was conducted to search for existing \niden­tical or similar trademarks. A linguistic check \nwas then carried out to rule out potentially nega-\ntive meanings or associations in the various \nChinese dialects, including Cantonese, Mandarin, \nShang­hainese, Sichuanese, and Taiwanese. Finally, \nthe top ten Chinese brand names were tested in  \nconsumer focus groups.\nCreative solution: The English name, Everwines, \nreflects the brand attributes of self-­enjoyment, \nself-­expression, and the importance of time to \ncreate a fine wine. The final Chinese name chosen \nwas \n (y\u001fong táo). \n (y\u001fong) means to sing or \npraise; it also is pronounced the same as \n \n(y\u001fong, “forever”), thus corresponding to “Ever” in \nthe English name. \n (táo) means grape, the \nsource of wine. Both the English and Chinese \nnames are expressive and appealing while being \neasy for Chinese customers to read and \nremember. Lab­brand designed an attractive visual \nidentity system for Everwines that was inspired by \na plen­titude of grapes, and a sense of discovery \nand enlightenment about a new range of tastes \nand sensations. The identity is displayed in \nEverwines retail spaces and on promotional items,  \npackaging, and marketing materials, as well as on \nthebrand website and the iPad app. The interior of  \nthe Everwines shops was designed by Naço \nArchitecture.\nResults: The Everwines brand’s young, appealing, \nand cosmopolitan image supports Torres’s goal of \nbecoming a leading retail wine chain in China. The \nmodern and approachable stores, an e-­commerce \nwebsite, and a VIP club and wine education pro-\ngrams have helped consumers shift their \nperception and desire for high-­quality wines. The \nshop is also the first in Shanghai to use an iPad \nwine list. Wine lovers can select their choice of \nwine through this innovative technology.\nEverwines: Labbrand\n239",

It has been diligent about \nprotecting its brand assets (name, trademark, \ntagline) and its monolithic brand architecture is \napplied consistently across sectors and around the \nworld. Continuous improvement requires that \nexisting processes and tools be reevaluated peri-\nodically to be sure they are clear, state-of-the-art, \nand engaging. In 2008, the GE Brand \nManagement staff began a process to validate \ncurrent practices and recommend improvements. \nThis started with surveys of GE Brand Central \nusers to determine issues and opportunities \nmoving forward. The results identified several \nareas for improvement, including how information \nis organized and searchable; cataloging of \nresources such as logo, image and template files; \nintegration of best practices; and establishing a \nplatform with expansion capabilities. Executive \nsupport was secured to move into a site enhance-\nment project that would shift the focus from \nguideline compliance to brand engagement.\nCreative solution: GE partnered with Monigle \nAssociates to develop the next generation GE \nBrand Central. The initial steps for the project \nwere focused on integrating the summary of the \nsurvey results into a scope of work document that \nwould deliver an enhanced experience for users \nand improve brand management processes. \nSpecific functions and content were identified, as \nwell as future phase modules to extend the site \nover the long term. The project required collabora-\ntion with agencies as well as GE’s design team. \nThe new configuration includes a more robust \nbrand strategy section, enhanced guidelines and \npolicies, new search functionality to distribute \nbrand assets, a best practices library, project man-\nagement tools to collect new creative services \nprojects and manage them through implementa-\ntion, and a content management system to \nfacilitate site updates by GE Brand Management \nteam members and agencies. \nResults: GE Brand Central was relaunched in \nFebruary 2009, supported by a significant com-\nmunications campaign to build awareness and \nusage. The site is generating consistently positive \nreviews from both power and occasional users. \nFeedback validates that key improvement objec-\ntives have been met. Site usage is up 25% \ncompared to peak usage patterns of the previous \nsite. Other metrics track efficiencies in creative \nservices project submissions, distribution of brand \nassets, most popular content, and overall ROI con-\ntribution of the site.

Global Hand­\nwashing Day was established in 2008 by PPPHW \nto motivate people around the world to adopt \nhandwashing with soap. Once October 15 was  \nestablished as Global Handwashing Day, PPPHW \ndecided that a unique and ownable visual identity \nwas needed for the global campaign. The identity \nneeded to translate easily across multiple cultures \nand languages to communicate its powerful, life-\nsaving message. Procter & Gamble (part of \nPPPHW’s international coalition of stakeholders) \nand its Safeguard brand team asked Landor \nAssociates to create an identity for an annual \ncampaign that would help transform handwashing \nwith soap from an abstract good idea into an auto-\nmatic behavior performed in homes, schools, and \ncommunities worldwide. The firm began its pro-\ncess by auditing other successful \nbehavior-­changing global campaigns to establish \ndesign criteria.\nCreative solution: In response to the brief from \nSafeguard, the flagship soap brand of Procter & \nGamble, six Landor offices around the world col-\nlaborated to create an iconic, memorable identity \nthat would play a role in encouraging the adoption \nof a lifesaving behavior. The identity needed to be \nappealing and easily understood by adults and \nchildren in different cultures worldwide. It needed \nto be pictorial and not dependent on language, \nand it needed to work in a range of applications, \nmedia, and scales. Landor designed three friendly \nand appealing characters holding hands that com-\nmunicate that when water and hands are brought \ntogether with soap, health is the result—and \nhealth is worth smiling about. Landor developed \nidentity guidelines, sample applications, and envi-\nronmental standards that could be used by event \nplanners and future stakeholders in their myriad \nefforts to build awareness across various commu-\nnication channels. The firm also created multiple \npromotional materials for the inaugural event that \nincluded a planners guide for local teams in sixty \ncountries, figurines, and cause bracelets.\nResults: Global Handwashing Day has become \nthe centerpiece of a global campaign that has  \nmotivated over 200 million people in over one \nhundred countries. 2012 will mark its fourth year. It \nhas become a powerful platform for advocacy by  \npolicymakers and has inspired concrete public \ncommitment to actions that will spur public change \nand shift behavior.

As an early proponent of consumer protec-\ntion, Good Housekeeping magazine created \ntesting labs to evaluate products for their readers. \nProducts advertised in the magazine that bear  \nthe seal are tested by GHRI and are backed by  \na two-­year limited warranty.\nTo celebrate the one hundredth anniversary, Good \nHousekeeping commissioned a new seal to be \ndrawn by Louise Fili Ltd. Director of Brand \nDevelopment Sara Rad wrote a brand brief, \nsearched through the archives to uncover the \nseal’s history, and organized a small team of deci-\nsion makers. There had been a total of eight  \ndifferent designs of the seal since 1909. “Good \nHousekeeping was seeking an update that would \nseamlessly combine its classic history with a  \nmodern type aesthetic. The goal was to design  \nthis one to last a long, long time.”\nCreative solution: The Seal’s many revisions \nhave always been a reflection of the style of the \ntimes. Right from the start, Louise Fili and the \ncommittee at Good Housekeeping knew they \nwanted the Seal to convey a timeless quality. \nAccording to Fili, “I wanted the Seal to look as \nthough it had always been there—classic but not \nretro. And in a style that exudes reassurance and \ntrust.” Having done design makeovers for many \ncompanies, she learned that a lot can be changed, \nas long as at least one element stays the same.  \nIn this case it was immediately apparent to her \nthat the oval needed to stay, as well as the star,  \nif possible. Fili also revisited the typeface in this \nmakeover, opting for Neutraface—a classic set  \nof letterforms based on the work of famed modern \narchitect Richard Neutra. The design process  \nalso took into consideration that the Seal would  \nbe reproduced in dramatically different scales  \nand media.\nResults: The new and improved Good House­\nkeeping Seal made its debut on the Today Show, \non a float at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, \nand on a billboard in Times Square, all in  \nthe same week. The magazine planned an entire \nyear of Seal-­related features for its 25 million \nreaders.

Their mission was to inform \nparents about toxic substances in the environment \nthat could seriously harm their children. In 2005, \nwhen Christopher Gavigan became executive \ndirector, he realized that nonprofit’s name was \nunwieldy and the acronym CHEC caused a lot of \nconfusion. Michael Cronan and Karin Hibma, part-\nners in CRONAN, started to work with the \norganization to ask the big questions, to conduct \nextensive research, and to examine the identity. \nAfter interviewing the board and leadership teams, \nCronan and Hibma came back to CHEC with an \nextensive list of names to consider. They chal-\nlenged the decision makers to look at each name \nand ask, “Is it unique enough that we can own it? \nDoes it identify who we are? When people hear it, \ndoes it sound familiar (which is a good thing) and \nis it memorable?” And perhaps most importantly \nfor an organization that Cronan believed was on \nthe verge of launching a movement, “Is it a name \npeople can rally behind?”\nCreative solution: Hibma believes that the best \nnames facilitate storytelling. The new name, \nHealthy Child Healthy World, not only captures the \nessence of what was to become one of the most \ntrusted organizations advocating for children’s \nhealth, but it is easy to remember and differenti-\nated from most nonprofits. Most importantly, it \nclearly states the goal of everyone working for the \norganization. The visual identity that CRONAN \ndesigned had the lightness and joy that we see  \nin every happy child’s face. The freckle-faced  \ngirl in the identity is Colette. The logo is really a  \nportrait of the founders’ daughter.

    "chunk_full": "251\nProcess and strategy: The things that matter to \nHerman Miller—design innovation, high-perfor-\nmance ofﬁce systems, and seating—have \ncoexisted with environmental advocacy for \ndecades. Products from the 1950s are still in use \ntoday. Founder D. J. DePree required all new sites \nto be 50 percent green space, and in 1953 said, \n“Herman Miller shall be a good corporate steward \nof the environment.” In the late 1980s, a group of \nemployees pushed senior management to take a \nstrong position on the environment. In 1989, the \ngroup formed what became the Environmental \nQuality Action Team to formulate and monitor \nenvironmental policy. In 1993, Herman Miller col-\nlaborated with architects, engineers, developers, \nbuilders, product manufacturers, nonprofits, and \ngovernment agencies to cocreate the US Green \nBuilding Council to find ways to get people to \nbuild more sustainably. The group’s biggest contri-\nbution was setting up LEED (Leadership in \nEnergy and Environmental Design) standards, \ndesigned to boost green-building practices.\nCreative solution: Becoming a sustainable busi-\nness is intrinsic to Herman Miller’s spirit, value \nsystem, and heritage. This commitment is demon-\nstrated by its numerous green building facilities, its \ndesign process and products, its management’s \nbenchmarks, and environmental education. In \n2003, the Mirra was the first chair designed from \nthe ground up to meet Herman Miller’s stringent \nDesign for the Environment (DfE) protocols, which \nfocus on creating economic value while simultane-\nously valuing the environment. It is made of a \nminimal number of parts and is easily disassem-\nbled for recycling. The Embody chair is 96 percent \nrecyclable and PVC free. Herman Miller communi-\ncates regularly and across media about “Perfect \nVision,” a broad initiative that sets significant \nsustainability targets for the year 2020, including \nzero landfill, zero hazardous waste generation, 100 \npercent green electrical energy use, and 100 per-\ncent of sales from DfE-approved products. Even \nthe business cards are used to communicate the \nthings that matter most, from a better world to \ntransparency and sustainability goals.\nResults: The CEO’s scorecard includes environ-\nmental goals. As of 2012, Herman Miller has \nreduced its operational footprint by 88 percent \nand now uses 100 percent renewable electric \nenergy for operations worldwide. Its fuel-saving \ninitiatives have rolled up to more than 430,000 \ncar-miles avoided due to biking or carpooling and \nmore than $111,000 reimbursed to employees for \nthe purchase of bicycles or fuel-efficient vehicles. \nIn 2012, for the fourth consecutive year, Herman \nMiller received a perfect score on the Corporate \nEquality Index from the Human Rights Campaign.\nMirra, designed 2003\n251",

I hope that \nHigh Line will inspire \nothers to pursue their \nunlikely dreams.\nRobert Hammond\nCofounder\nFriends of the High Line\nProcess and strategy: In 1999, Robert \nHammond and Joshua David formed a group \ncalled Friends of the High Line to try to stop New \nYork City from tearing down an old industrial ele-\nvated railway structure on Manhattan’s west side. \nNeither of the two visionaries had any urban plan-\nning or park experience, but they shared an \naudacious idea of turning the High Line into a \nwildscape and a park. They wanted a logo, \nletterhead, and some business cards, so they \nwould look official. Paula Scher, Pentagram \npartner, quickly and intuitively envisioned the train \ntracks that make an H, and designed an iconic \nand simple symbol, and jump-started them with \nsome basics. What followed for the fledgling orga-\nnization was a decade of relationship building, \npublic forums, fundraising, legal battles, court chal-\nlenges, negotiations with elected officials and \nlandowners, exhibitions, and studies to analyze the \nphysical, social, and cultural and economic benefit \nto the city. A design competition ultimately \nattracted 720 teams from thirty-six countries.\nCreative solution: Throughout the decade prior \nto the park’s realization, Scher’s team designed an \nintegrated communications system that would \ngrow organically from the intelligence of the initial \nidea. The font family Avenir Next was chosen as \nthe core typeface, and the color green was used \nconsistently. In 2002, Pentagram designed \nReclaiming the High Line, a study of the project \npotential by the Design Trust for Public Space. The \ncover featured a photograph by Joel Sternfeld, \nwhose images of the abandoned rail line showed \nits extraordinary beauty and potential, and became \nan important element of the campaign to save the \nstructure. The identity system has consistently \nembodied the High Line’s vision. It has worked \nacross fundraising literature, event invitations, \ncampaign brochures, magazine designs, books, \npresentations, installations, and exhibits. After \nJames Corner Field Operations, a landscape archi-\ntecture firm, and Diller Scofidio + Renfro, an \narchitecture firm, did the initial plans, Pentagram \ndesigned a wayfinding and signage system. The \nHigh Line opened in June 2009.\nResults: The High Line has become one of New \nYork City’s most visited destination and a model \nfor other urban projects around the world to repur-\npose industrial structures. The Friends of the High \nLine now provide over 90 percent of the High \nLine’s annual operating budget and are respon-\nsible for maintenance of the park, pursuant to a \nlicense agreement with the New York City \nDepartment of Parks and Recreation.

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: In 2009, IBM reached  \nout to its partner agencies and asked them to \nexplore and conceptualize an identity for IBM’s \n2011 centennial celebration. After three months of \nvigo­rous experimentation and ideation, IBM’s top \nmarketing, communications, and brand teams \ngathered alongside the agency teams to look at \nhundreds of sketches, and to form a vision for the \ncentennial identity. Ideas were deconstructed and \ndiscussed while new designs were generated. \nA rough collaged sketch that integrated Paul \nRand’s landmark 1972 8-­bar logo with a Selectric \ntypewriter sparked an epiphany: Why only one? \nWhat if we had a system of one hundred marks \nand the moments they celebrate? What if we \n paid homage to the ideas and innovations that \nhave shaped who we are? It would be called  \nIBM 100 Icons of Progress. A dedicated, thirty-­\nmember team was formed to oversee a cadre of \ndevelopers, designers, writers, content managers, \nproducers, editors, and subject matter experts.\nCreative solution: Each icon needed to be a \nunique vessel for meaning and storytelling. The \ncontent process began with a call for submissions \nto IBMers around the world: “We want to know \nabout the innovations, projects, and partnerships—\npast and present—that had led to transformative \nchange in local and regional markets, helping to \nmake the world work better.” While hundreds of \nsubmissions were being reviewed, VSA Partners \nled an exploration process to develop a cohesive \nand flexible design and content system. Each icon \nneeded to function as a visually arresting prompt \nfor a powerful idea, and was based on the number \none hundred. An exhaustive internal and external \nreview process of 860 stories was edited to one \nhundred iconic moments. A team of writers, edi-\ntors, and content managers conducted additional \nresearch and crafted the voice and tone of each \nstory. Design­ers drew inspiration from the IBM \narchives, third-­party materials, and both contempo-\nrary and historical art and culture. The design team \ncreated thousands of iterations in order to best \ncapture the iconic story behind each mark.\nResults: The Icons of Progress were launched in \nearly 2011 on IBM100.com and multiple other \nchannels throughout the year. The stories ignited \nconversations in 186 countries about the many \nways that IBM has transformed business, science, \nand society, from helping to put the first man  \non the moon to developing the bar code and the \npersonal computer. For IBM, the value of its  \ncentennial lies not in merely celebrating past  \naccomplishments, but in recognizing fundamental \npatterns of progress as a means to look forward \nand seed the future.\nWe never imagined how \npowerful and engaging the \nstories were to our clients, \nour workforce, and other \nforward thinkers around \nthe globe.\nTerry Yoo\nDirector, Brand Expression\nIBM\nIBM 100 Icons of Progress: VSA Partners\n255",

In \nthat sense, IBM is in the \nbusiness of helping people \nuse information to think in \nnew ways.\nJon Iwata\nSVP, Marketing and \nCommunications\nIBM\nWhat was particular to IBM \nWatson was our team’s \naltruism. We could actually \nsee if we got it right, that it \nwould really spark people’s \nimagination about how \nIBM could really change \nthe world for the \nbetterment of humanity.\nDavid Korchin\nSenior Partner,  \nGroup Creative Director\nOgilvy & Mather Worldwide\nProcess and strategy: For a number of years, \nIBM scientists worked on a highly advanced com-\nputing system that could understand human \nlanguage. The research team believed that this \nsystem would be able to answer complex ques-\ntions with enough precision, confidence, and \nspeed to compete on Jeopardy!, an American TV \nquiz show. Since 80 percent of all the world’s new \ndata is stored in human language, IBM believed \nthat this scientific advancement had the potential \nto transform many industries, and solve some of \nthe world’s most critical problems. IBM challenged \nits agency, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, to stage \nthe event, to create the visual representation of \nthe technology, and to communicate to a global \naudience about the far-­reaching relevance and \nvalue of this complex computing system. While the \nresearch scientists worked on system intelligence, \nthe Ogilvy creative team pondered these ques-\ntions: What should it look like? How human should \nit be? How will it work on TV? What should we call \nit? VSA, a partner agency, suggested Watson, in \nhonor of IBM’s visionary president, Thomas J. \nWatson.\nCreative solution: The design process demon-\nstrated what happens when science meets art. \nThe challenge was to achieve the right balance \nbetween human emotional characteristics and dig-\nital data. After designing hundreds of visual \nconcepts, the Ogilvy creative team realized that \nthe avatar needed to visually connect to IBM \nSmarter Planet. Watson was clearly a part of the \nIBM agenda to contribute to a world that is instru-\nmented, interconnected, and intelligent. The \ncreative breakthrough was to develop an answer \npanel visible to the TV audience that would \nsomehow reveal Watson’s thinking process and \nconfidence level. Digital artist Joshua Davis devel-\noped a series of animated patterns that were \nbased on data generated by Watson while playing \nthe game. While the public face was being devel-\noped, the agency explained the science behind \nmore than two thousand computer processors \nworking in concert, and began to educate the \nworld about the possibilities of this technology.  \nA video series was developed that documented \nWatson’s journey through the eyes of the IBM \nresearchers led by principal investigator  \nDavid Ferrucci.\nResults: Although IBM Watson outperformed  \nits human opponents in its first public test on \nJeopardy! in February 2011, IBM views the real \ntest as applying the underlying systems, data  \nmanagement, and analytics technology across  \ndifferent industries, beginning with health care. \nIBM Watson attracted global media coverage,  \ngarnering over a billion impressions. A whole new \ndivision was subsequently formed to apply this \ntechnology, but the profound value was to the  \nIBM culture, inspiring IBM employees around the \nworld with a new sense of purpose and pride.\nThe avatar is programmed to \nreflect Watson’s thinking \nprocess.\nIBM: Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide\n257",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: Europe is a continent  \nof fascinating destinations. Cities like Ieper need  \nto differentiate themselves in order to thrive and \nattract a younger population. As a scene of inten-\nsive fighting during World War I, the city’s image \nwas inextricably tied to the past and the Battle of \nYpres, which is the English name. An in-­depth \nmarketing and communication analysis was con-\nducted by the city. The result was a new plan that \nfocused on three priorities: tourism, the working \nand living environment, and the economic and \nsociocultural development of citizens and entre-\npreneurs. Lemento, a brand consultancy in \nAntwerp, Belgium, was engaged to create a com-\npelling and unique city image, and a brand promise \nthat reinforced these priorities. Instead of building \nan image solely around its rich history, Ieper \nneeded to become an international meeting point \nfor the past and the future. The brand promise cre-\nated by Lemento was “Everybody \nIeper”—everyone (young and old, citizens and \ntourists, families and companies) is welcome in \nIeper and can find something in this city they like.\nCreative solution: Inspired by the city’s versatility \nand informed by a competitive analysis, Lemento \ndeveloped an authentic, future-­facing brand that \npays homage to the past but welcomes the future. \nThe visual concept design is based on the bold \nRoman numeral I, referring both to World War I \nand to the first letter of the city’s name in Dutch \n(Ieper). The “I” also represents the characteristics \nof the Belgian city: intriguing, inspiring, interna-\ntional, intensive, intimate, inno­vating, and \ninteresting. The simple and iconic shape was \ndesigned to work well at large and small scales, \nincluding signage, information booths, vehicles, \nbanners, and benches. The identity is designed to \nbe part of the everyday experience. In addition, the \nIeper brand architecture is a consistent, monolithic \nentity, creating a unified family of city services \nworking together. Every city service has its own \nname, juxtaposed to the master brand.\nResults: Numerous events were organized to \nmake the new brand promise understandable and \nthe new identity visible. After a decade of popula-\ntion decline, the numbers of inhabitants and \nvisitors have increased. The number of enterprises  \nin Ieper has grown 3.5 percent in the three years \nfollowing the launch of the new plan and posi-\ntioning. Along with high-visibility signage and \nbanners, the city’s internal agencies are actively \nusing the guidelines in the city magazine, event \nposters, and marketing literature.\nIeper: Lemento\n259",

Initially called Standard Nine, the start-\nup needed a permanent name for its first product \nlaunch. A Hundred Monkeys, a naming boutique, \nwas engaged to lead the small team through a \ndisciplined naming process. Danny Altman, \nfounder and CEO, began with in-depth interviews \nof the core team, then returned each week with a \nnew set of names. The multilingual, decision-\nmaking team worked collaboratively to hone down \nthe possibilities. “There’s a big difference between \neducation and learning.

Early in the naming process, MacInnis \nretained MetaDesign, a branding firm, to start envi-\nsioning the brand and its positioning. After a small \nset of names was agreed upon, trademark and \ndomain availability research began. \nCreative solution: From the beginning of the pro-\ncess, MacInnis understood the strategy and \nnuances of naming. “We very much believed that \nthe word we chose would be an empty vessel that \nwe would fill.

Its \nacquisition of York in 2005 helped the company \nbuild its diversified revenue base and strong repu-\ntation for optimizing building efficiency. \nRepositioning the corporate brand would support \na higher valuation. Ready to broaden market per-\nceptions about its capabilities, Johnson Controls \nengaged Lippincott to leverage the company’s \nmarket leadership and fuel future growth. The ini-\ntial phase of work focused on a qualitative \nassessment of brand strengths and challenges. \nLippincott conducted an extensive global brand \nassessment to determine key market needs, \nimage drivers, and high-potential growth areas. \nThe findings were then translated into a unique \ncorporate positioning strategy that builds on \nJohnson Controls’ ability to create appealing envi-\nronments for customers across many areas of \ntheir lives—homes, cars, and offices. The posi-\ntioning was then converted into a brand promise \nto engage employees to “live the brand.”\nCreative solution: After the new positioning \nstrategy and brand assessments were complete, \nLippincott redesigned an entire global visual iden-\ntity system, from the website and marketing \nliterature to vehicles and signage. The new system \npositioned Johnson Controls as a forward-thinking \nenterprise that is commercializing innovation glob-\nally at an accelerated pace. A new symbol was \ndesigned and named “the open globe.” A new \nmessaging platform was developed and applied to \nnew sales presentations and product literature. \nLippincott recommended a more efficient master \nbrand model and a plan for brand transition, \nincluding a new communications and advertising \nvendor. Detailed brand guidelines were developed \nto bring the recommendations to life. The company \ngenerated momentum for the introduction of the \nnew brand strategy through the design of an inter-\nactive online brand center for employees and \nexternal agencies.\nResults: Johnson Controls believes that building \nits brand will enable it to better compete for  \nthe best talent in all of its geographic markets and \nsupport continued growth and market share.  \nIt has consistently outperformed its underlying \nindustries. In 2011, Corporate Responsibility \nMagazine recognized Johnson Controls as the \nnumber one company in its annual “100 Best \nCorporate Citizens” list.

In the \n1930s, the company opened up a whole new \nmarket by repositioning it as a disposable hand-\nkerchief. Today, Kleenex brand box is omnipresent \nin homes and offices in more than 150 countries. \nAlthough the Kleenex brand has maintained its \nposition as the number one facial tissue in the \nworld, increased global competition has necessi-\ntated marketing intelligence and innovation. \nHistoric packaging innovations like the upright \ncube box, the travel pack, and color illustration \nenlivened the category, but the Kleenex brand \nneeded a new breakthrough to create consumer \npreference. Christine Mau, brand design director in \nthe Kimberly-Clark Global Design group, led by \nDayton Henderson, worked with a multidisciplinary \nteam of market researchers, engineers, designers, \nand branding experts, to answer the question, \n“How do we leverage the power of strategic \ndesign against business objectives to grow this \nbrand?” The team embarked on a process to rein-\nvent a product category that had become \npredicable and taken for granted.\nCreative solution: Mau has led a series of design \ninnovations to build the Kleenex brand by exam-\nining core identity, positioning, packaging, product \ndevelopment, and aesthetics. The logotype was \nredesigned to reflect the brand’s \nfriendly positioning. Consumer insights and trend \nforecasting were leveraged to radically rethink the \ncategory. Although changing structure required \nenormous engineering production and engineering \ninvestments, the teams began the process to liter-\nally “think outside the box.” In 2006, the \nrevolutionary oval was launched. In 2009, the \n“slices of summer” wedge boxes were launched. \nThe on-the-go category was reinvented next: auto \npacks were designed to fit in the door pocket or to \nbe wedged between the seats or visor. Wallet \npacks were designed to be slim, stylish, and easy \nto toss into a backpack or back pocket. In 2012, \nthe Kleenex brand formed strategic partnerships \nwith Disney, Shutterfly, and Major League Baseball \nand offered consumers the opportunity to express \nthemselves by customizing Kleenex brand ovals \non mykleenextissue.com with different back-\ngrounds, photos, clip art, and text. \nResults: Kleenex brand has revitalized a brand \ncategory with design thinking, resulting in \nincreased revenues and market share. New mer-\nchandising opportunities have been created and \nthe brand has become relevant to Gen Yers. \nChallenging convention, understanding sales \ncycles as well as the lives and lifestyles of con-\nsumers, and building a business case for \ninnovation were all critical success factors in \ndriving Kleenex brand’s continuous innovation.\nWe’re reaching new \nconsumers in a way that we \nhaven’t been able to before.\nJim Schuh\nDigital Marketing Manager\nKimberly-Clark\n265",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: After quitting their jobs  \nas diamond cutters in New York City, Francesco \nRealmuto and Salvatore Potestio searched for the \nbest gelato artisans in Italy. In 2009, they opened \nL’Arte del Gelato, their first gelateria, in Chelsea \nMarket. Unlike their competitors’ product, this \ngelato is made fresh every day, with the best \ningredients: the freshest fruit, pistachios from \nSicily’s Bronte region, and coffee beans from \nArgentina. Their identity, however, reflected neither \ntheir vision nor anything artisanal or Italian. They \nwere introduced to Louise Fili, a designer who \nloves food and all things Italian. When she was in \nFlorence researching her book, The Civilized \nShopper’s Guide to Florence, she taste-­tested \ngelato at least twice a day. Fili’s design process \nbegan with an in-­depth interview, to fully under-\nstand her clients’ vision. Her family came from \nSicily, and conversations about design, gelato, and \nlife were all in Italian. Fili was taken with the supe-\nriority of the gelato, and proceeded to sketch \nseveral ideas.\nCreative solution: When Fili thought about gelato \nand Italy in general, she conjured up that won-\nderful, carefree nostalgia of early black-­and-­white \nfilms starring Vittorio De Sica. She wanted the new \nidentity to reference that romanticism, as well as \nthe authenticity of the product. Many years ago, on \na trip to Italy, Fili discovered Italian pastry papers \nfrom the 1930s. These lighthearted, decorative \npapers inspired her to focus her career on food \npackaging and restaurants. She showed the \npapers to Realmuto, who agreed that they \nembodied a look and feel that was right for L’Arte \ndel Gelato. The distinctive triangular shape Fili \ndesigned then became a vessel for her hand-­\ndrawn typography. The Italian words fresco ogni \ngiorno were designed as part of the mark to com-\nmunicate “made fresh every day.” The color palette \nwas inspired by strawberry gelato and passion fruit \nsorbetto, and conveyed happiness, true to the \nexperience. Fili also redesigned the website, which \ncan be read in either Italian or English.\nResults: The new identity helped L’Arte del Gelato \nattract new customers and garner coveted media \nattention. During the warmer months, the gelato  \nis sold around the city in carts imported from  \nItaly. In the summer of 2011, L’Arte del Gelato \nwas awarded one of five coveted spots for arti-\nsanal/gourmet food carts on the High Line.  \nThe newest publicity coup is a 1971 Fiat \nCinquecento (shipped over from Sicily) driven \naround the city by Realmuto. Like his gelato, it \nmakes everyone smile.\nWhen we speak about design \nand gelato, we converse in \nItalian. When we talk \nbusiness, we speak in \nEnglish.\nLouise Fili⁜\nFounder and Designer⁜\nLouise Fili Ltd.\nL’Arte del Gelato: Louise Fili Ltd.\n267",

The team examined the compa-\nny’s operations, wholesale clients, retail customers, \nmarket segment, and competitive set. Their goal \nwas to launch a new identity in tandem with the \nlaunch of a new line of production dinnerware, \nwhile also building a platform for increasing retail \nsales, entering new houseware product catego-\nries, and engaging financial and manufacturing \npartners for expanding production.\nCreative solution: Noting the explosion of indi-\nvidual designers reaching name recognition \nthrough mass-­market retailers, Bjornson recom-\nmended a name change from Zindel Ceramics  \nto Laura Zindel Design, and acquired the URL  \nlaurazindel.com. A versatile symbol was developed \nthat recalled antique colophons, referencing  \nthe creativity, craftsmanship, and uniqueness of \nZindel’s work. Known for her graphite illustrations, \nZindel created a drawing of a partridge that was \nemblem­atic of the 1778 farmhouse she and \nLauterbach now occupied in Vermont.

Little & Company was \nengaged to examine brand architecture and its \nimpact on marketing, new campaigns, and exhibits. \nFrom the beginning, the process was collaborative \nand engaged all of the sites, exhibits, and mar-\nketing teams. Little used three methods to gather \ninsights: interviews with site managers and exhibit \ndevelopers; on-­site visits, visitor observation, and \ncasual intercepts (that is, no formal questionnaire); \nand a review of annual visitor and member sur-\nveys. After the discovery phase, the strategy phase \nfocused on clarifying positioning and personality. \nRegardless of the site, the twenty-six sub-­brands \nneeded an umbrella strategy to increase traffic \nand a way to leverage a deeper affinity for the \nmaster brand.\nCreative solution: Over the course of seven \nyears, Little worked with the Society to become a \nconsumer-­centric marketer, raising its influence as \nthe one brand keeper for all of its site affiliations. \nTraditionally, the Society had employed a mar-\nketing strategy that distributed funds equitably \nacross all twenty-six historic sites and museums, \nseverely limiting the resources dedi­cated to the \ntop attractions. However, in 2003, the Society’s \nbrand architecture was reenvisioned and all mar-\nketing initiatives became part of a tiered system \nthat prioritized funds toward the top attractions. \nThis shift laid the groundwork for Little to create \nan authentic, site-­specific brand identity for top \nattractions Split Rock Lighthouse, Mill City \nMuseum, and Historic Fort Snelling. Campaigns \nwould now incorporate fresh and bold visual lan-\nguage, an audience-­friendly marketing tone, and a \nconsistent voice. The campaign art conveyed new \nexcitement and personality, and was used across \nmarketing channels, from the website through \nenvironmental graphics.\nResults: The new, more focused brand strategy \nhas allowed the Society to funnel its marketing \nbudget toward the top-­tier sites that feature the \nmost exceptional visitor experiences. Based on  \nthe philosophy that “a rising tide lifts all boats,” \nthese then became hubs for promoting the other \nsites around the state. The effectiveness of that \nstrategy, and the efficiencies it created, was a  \ncornerstone of the tiered-­site approach, which  \nhas achieved dramatic double-­digit increases at \ntargeted sites, and an overall increase statewide.\nAs caretakers of the \nMinnesota Historical Society \nbrand, we helped thread \ntogether existing equities  \nthat allowed the organization \nto speak as a stronger, \nsingular entity.\nJoseph Cecere\nPresident and Chief Creative Officer\nLittle & Company\nMinnesota Historical Society: Little & Company\n271",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: MoMA has one of the \nmost recognizable logotypes in the museum world. \nOriginally designed by Ivan Chermayeff in 1964, \nthe Franklin Gothic No. 2 logotype was redrawn in \na new custom typeface named MoMA Gothic by \nMatthew Carter in 2004. Although the core iden-\ntity itself is bold and iconic, the overall application \nacross web, print, and the physical environment \nhas not been cohesive or visionary like the \nmuseum itself. The marketing advisory committee \nof the museum identified revitalizing the communi-\ncations system as a priority. The museum engaged \nPenta­gram to design a more powerful and inte-\ngrated comprehensive system. “While the MoMA \nlogo is iconic, it alone is not enough to continually \ncarry the spirit of the institution,” said Paula Scher, \npartner and lead designer for the project.\nCreative solution: To create an attitude that \nmodernizes the institution’s image, Scher designed \na complete methodology for the new system that \nworks at any scale, from an exterior banner to a \nprint advertisement in the newspaper. A strong \ngrid was designed for the uniform placement of \nimages and type. Each quadrant of a page or a \nbanner has a specific function. And for the first \ntime in the museum’s history, artwork is being \ncropped to maximize visual impact and marketing. \nA bold, singular image is selected as the signature \nfocus of an exhibit, and is visually accompanied by \na text block that features upcoming events. The \nlogotype, always black on white, is used vertically \nwhen possible, and always bleeds off an edge. \nMoMA Gothic is the primary font for all typography \nin all applications. The system is very flexible. On  \napplications like banners and billboards, type and \nimages are used in multiples, creating a dynamic \npattern against the urban landscape.\nResults: The new system is being used for \nMoMA’s institutional and public communications, \nincluding brochures, banners, the website, and \nother materials. Individual exhibitions will continue \nto have their own identities, used in catalogues, \nwebsites, and exhibition graphics. Julia Hoffmann, \ncreative director of advertising and graphic design \nat MoMA, and her internal team have brought the \nsystem to life in applications from large banners \nand subway posters to the website. MoMA at long \nlast has an identity system that carries the spirit of  \nits iconic institution.\nThis project is one of a series \nof innovative initiatives \nconceived by a new marketing \nadvisory committee established \nby MoMA in January 2008. \nThe committee, composed of \nlocal advertising and design \nprofessionals, advises the \nmuseum on new avenues of \ncommunication and ways to \ndiversify and engage with its \naudience.

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: Soon after Alan Becker, \nNizuc’s developer, purchased the twenty-eight-­\nacre estate of the former Mexican president,  \nhe began a search for a hotel operator. He  \ninterviewed a number of international upscale \nhotel management companies who were more \ninterested in extending their brand equity  \nthan developing a vision for his site’s unique  \nattributes. “We wanted to be Mayan without  \nbeing thematic,” he says. Becker envisioned the \narchitecture to reflect the culture and heritage of \nthe Mayan civilization.\nBecker brought in Carbone Smolan Agency (CSA) \nto create a unique brand platform to establish the \ncore ideas from which all other decisions and part-\nnerships would emanate. Becker and CSA  \ncollaborated over the next nine months to under-\nstand conceptually and visually what the soul of \nthis new ultra-luxury destination would feel like \nand look like. The theme was “Mayan culture \nbrought into the twenty-first century.” This \nbranding-­first approach was considered a radical \ndeparture in the hotel industry.\nCreative solution: The luxury destination exists \non a peninsula, Punta Nizuc, which inspired the \nname. CSA began the creative process by \ndesigning a modern Mayan glyph as the \nbrandmark. The iconic, strong form lent itself to \ncreating beautiful patterns and facilitated the  \ndesign of objects of desire, from amulets to soaps \nand cookies. The second phase of the process \nwas about creating images that captured the soul \nand experience of a destination that was not yet \nbuilt. Led by design director Carla Miller, the cre-\native team packed twenty-two boxes of props and \nflew down to Mexico with a staff of designers, styl-\nists, models, and photographer Quentin Bacon. \nSeven eighteen-­hour days created a series of \nimages that celebrated beauty, magic, design, \nhigh-­end luxury, and otherworld­liness. These \nimages were then designed into a brand book that \nilluminated the essence of the destination.\nResults: The Nizuc branding process channeled \nthe vision of the developer, who brought in archi-\ntect Jean-Michel Gathy and Indonesian interior \ndesigner Jaya Ibrahim. Amid the destruction of the \nfinancial markets, Becker’s vision was put on hold. \nBut Nizuc lived. Five years later, a new developer, \nLas Brisas Hotels, heard the story of Nizuc and \nbought the land and the brand. Establishing a \nbrand platform and a branding-first approach \nworked from an investment perspective as well as \na marketing perspective. \nDesign was at the heart of \nour process.

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: NO MORE was created \nby fifty individuals from the private and public sec-\ntors who were frustrated by the fact that even \nthough domestic violence and sexual assault (DV/\nSA) are devastatingly pervasive—impacting rich, \npoor, young, old, male and female from every race, \nregion, and religion—the problem is not a priority \nin this country. These issues are underfunded with \nshame and stigma still surrounding them.\nTo address this, Anne Glauber, Virginia Witt, Maile \nZambuto, and Jane Randel led an effort to \nincrease visibility and better connect the public to \nthese issues. The question: How could we support \nsurvivors, show perpetrators that their crimes won’t \nbe tolerated, and demonstrate broad concern to \npublic officials? First they reached out to every \nmajor US DV/SA organization to share this bold \nstrategy that would help individuals, organizations, \nand national brands take action. Then they held \nnumerous exploratory meetings to build con-\nsensus and strategic alliances. Ultimately, all \nagreed that a universal symbol, widely visible \nacross platforms, could galvanize support, gen-\nerate funding, and increase awareness. \nCreative solution: The founders started by  \norganizing think tanks made up of leading  \nbranding and marketing experts who had never  \nconsidered these issues before. These creative \nvisioning sessions produced what ultimately \nbecame “NO MORE”—a symbol that expresses \nthe universal and collective emotion and impera-\ntive. Debbie Millman, President of the Design \nGroup at Sterling Brands, and Christine Mau, \nBrand Design Director, Kimberly-Clark, led the \ndesign process. Like the peace sign, the red AIDS \nribbon, or the pink breast cancer ribbon, the NO \nMORE symbol will be used by the public, \ninfluencers, and DV/SA organizations to move \nthese issues higher on the public’s agenda. As \nsuch, it has to work across platforms—from a \nTwitter page on a mobile device to a T-shirt. A \nthree-year launch plan calls for celebrities, \ninfluencers, and everyday people to wear the \nsymbol to express their commitment and inspire \naction. National brands and strategic alliances will \ndemonstrate their support through a variety of co-\nbranding platforms.\nResults: In early 2012, NO MORE conducted a \nsoft launch to 250 legislators, advocates, and pro-\nfessionals. In just four months, nomore.org has \nreceived more than 32,000 views, 300 photo sub-\nmissions, and 600 inquiries from advocates \nworldwide who want to help. Toolkits with logos, \nposters, handouts, social media posts, and presen-\ntations in English and Spanish were made \navailable. A media blitz in late 2012 will leverage \nsocial networks, print, broadcast, online PSAs, \nmerchandise, and high-publicity events to gen-\nerate support. A partnership with a NASCAR team \nhas been highly effective. \nNO MORE: Sterling Brands\n277",

FutureBrand was engaged to provide  \npositioning, brand strategy, and design services  \nfor the country with the long-­term goal of building \ntourism, exports, and investments. The research \nprocess included multidisciplinary global, national, \nand local perspectives from a broad team of  \nexperts. Tours of archeological districts, tourism \nsites, museums, and various manufacturing areas \nincluded interviews with different stakeholder \ngroups. FutureBrand developed various posi-\ntioning platforms that were evaluated in eight \nPeruvian regions and seven cities in prioritized \nexternal markets.\nThe strategic platforms led to positioning the Peru \nbrand based on three pillars: multifaceted, special-\nized, and captivating, reflecting the country’s \nuniqueness from a cultural and natural standpoint. \nA team of brand ambassadors from tourism,  \nexports, and investments agreed that Peru’s big \nidea was evolution, change, and transformation.\nCreative solution: Peru is the birthplace of South \nAmerican civilization, with both natural and man-\nmade wonders, from the magic citadel of Machu \nPicchu to the Amazon rainforest. The juxtaposition \nof indigenous cultures such as Inca, Nazca, \nMoche, and Mochica with Spanish cultures \ninspired the FutureBrand team to design an iconic \nspiral form that emanates from the letterform P, \nreflecting evolution and transformation. The icon, \nlike a fingerprint, communicates that “there is a \nPeru for each individual.” The design team also  \ndeveloped a proprietary image style to capture  \nthe wonders of the country. The iconic color is  \nred, with a default to white. TypeTogether created \na proprietary font family to complement the brand \nidentity system. FutureBrand created guidelines \nthat are clearly explained in a brand book.\nResults: Peru’s new image was launched nation-\nally in March 2011 by means of an advertising \ncampaign created by Young & Rubicam. Today  \nthe new identity is visible throughout the country. \nTourists are greeted with it in airports and train \nstations, and citizens of all ages and means wear \nPeru brand T-­shirts. The campaign has engen-\ndered a widespread sentiment: “I am proud to be \nPeruvian.” Working together, the public and private \nsectors continue to build tourism and exports  \nand position Peru in the global marketplace.\nThe brand was displayed in the first-ever Peru Day \non Times Square and Wall Street in New York.\n281",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: When the PNC Financial \nServices Group (PNC) acquired National City \nCorporation (NCC), an unprecedented level of \nconversion activity was required to manufacture \nand install over 26,000 new signs at 1,640 \nbranches, facilities, and 1,524 ATMs in over nine \nstates. A multi-­team task force was formed with \nPNC Realty Services and National City’s Facilities \nManagement team members. PNC engaged \nMonigle Associates, a national brand conversion \nconsulting company, to provide expertise and \nassist in managing the day-­to-­day tactical project \nrollout. The project demanded strict adherence to \nthe defined conversion schedule, the highest \nquality of product and installation standards, and \ncontrol of the project’s costs. An overarching goal \nwas adherence to PNC’s core values: first, to \nmaintain customer relationships with PNC and \nNCC customers and second, to hold true to PNC’s \n“green” values. The project started with a sixteen-­\nweek supplier evaluation to examine production \nand installation capabilities. Monigle Associates’ \nproject management software, SignCHART, \nhoused specifications and tracked milestones and \nmetrics critical to managing multiple contractors \nthrough the complex conversion process.\nCreative solution: Although PNC’s standard  \nfamily of signs had been previously established, \nimprovements were made to increase energy  \nefficiency and branding needs. Once facility  \ndesign recommendations were approved by the \nSign Conversion Team, all of the sign recommen-\ndation packages were personally delivered to the \nindividual Retail Market Managers for their final \nreview. After the branding was approved, sign \npackages for leased sites were sent by the  \nPNC Leasing Group to landlords for review and \napproval. Some high-­visibility sites underwent \ncomplex variance process hearings with zoning \nand architectural review boards. Beyond the direct \nsavings achieved from lower-­cost manufacturing \nand installation, ongoing expenses were reduced \nthrough the analysis and implementation of a  \nnew LED illuminated package of signs. Power \nconsumption of an average wall sign was reduced \nby 62 percent without sacrificing quality and \nrequired less effort to maintain. Fifty percent of \nthe suppliers who were awarded business had \nstrong relationships with the bank, and minority \nsuppliers represented almost 25 percent of the \nworkforce, which had a positive impact on the \ndiversity of PNC’s supplier portfolio.\nResults: The entire conversion took seventy-six \nweeks from kickoff to completion. A check system \nverified that all markets in each phase were \npleased with the sign conversion results. PNC and \nNCC employees utilized an internal news network \nto talk about the quality and speed of the project, \nwhich coincided with the phased rollout of \nbranding. The Strategic Sourcing Team’s multi-\nmedia presentations focused on the savings and \ndiversity impact. The Sign Conversion Team \nreceived numerous accolades from executive \nmanagement regarding how well the sign  \nconversion project was planned, communicated, \nand executed.\nOur goal was to improve the \nbranding and visibility at \nevery National City location, \nwhile meeting tight \ntimeframes and managing \ncosts.\nKurt Monigle\nPrincipal\nMonigle Associates\nPNC Bank: Monigle Associates\n283",

The process began with the \nsenior management team reaffirming its vision for \nthe future: to be the best port infrastructure and \nintegrated logistics service company in the mar-\nkets in which it operates. Santos Brasil wanted to \nbe perceived as friendly and socially and environ-\nmentally responsible. The company wanted to be \npositioned as global, because its terminals had  \nthe operational efficiency of the world’s leading \nport terminals. Research studies revealed that \nthere was overall low awareness and brand visi-\nbility within the investment community. Cauduro’s \nanalysis and insights determined that the name \nSantos Brasil appealed to audiences around the \nworld. Santos, the largest port in Brasil, is relevant \nto the industry category, as well as a concrete  \nexpression of the company’s concern about its \ncommunities and commitment to sustainable  \ndevelopment.

Both the logistics and con-\ntainer management companies would be \norganized under the Santos Brasil master brand. \nNaming was streamlined and unified across busi-\nness units, so that future acquisitions would be  \nfacilitated. The new Santos Brasil symbol was \ndesigned to synthesize economic and symbolic \nvalue. The S design is a translation of Santos port \ngeog­raphy.

VSA’s Andy Gray and  \nTravis Barteaux worked closely with the founder \nand the director of lighting, marketing, and \n digital Michelle Steinback, to clearly define, what \nis the Schoolhouse Electric of furniture and \nhousewares, and what isn’t? It became clear to the \nteam that the name should evolve to Schoolhouse \nElectric & Supply Co.— retaining the equity of \n“Schoolhouse Electric” but reflecting a newly \nexpanded range of goods.\nCreative solution: VSA and Schoolhouse worked \ntogether for over a year on product inspiration, \nidentity design, catalogue concept and design, art \ndirection of photography, and website redesign. \n“We always imagined the identity as a series of \nlogos, which should feel as if they had evolved \nover time, like an unwritten history. Their usage \nwould be guided by application and context,” said \nGray. VSA used a fluid design process to help \nshape the brand persona.

Slice was founded in 2008 by TJ \nScimone to help fund long-­term care for his son, \nAlex, who is autistic. A portion of the product sales \nis donated to help fund autism research. Slice’s \nlaunch product was the world’s first box cutter with \na ceramic blade. It was designed by Scot Herbst, \ndirector of industrial design at Slice, and Alfredo \nMuccino, chief creative officer at Liquid Agency \nand chief branding officer at Slice. Liquid has  \ninfluenced every aspect of the brand, from building \ncollaborative relationships with world-­class \ndesigners like Karim Rashid, Yves Behar,  \nand Michael Graves, to developing visionary new \nproducts. All industrial design is based on the  \nphilosophy that design should bring simplicity and \ndelight to people’s lives. Liquid has been instru-\nmental in shaping the brand’s strategic platform \nand strategic relationships, and has provided  \ncreative direction for the design of the identity, \npackaging, website, exhibits, and merchandising.\nCreative solution: Liquid designed the Slice logo \nto be a simple and bold typographical solution; \npart of the name is literally sliced off. Orange was \nselected because it is vibrant and friendly, espe-\ncially against a neutral palette. Orange is also \ndesigned to be used on product design as a \nstrong element of the visual language of the \nbrand. The logo design can stand alone or be used \nin conjunction with the signature of the designer \nof each specific product. The website was \ndesigned as a showcase for the industrial design \nof the products, and as a means to leverage the \nname recognition and philosophy of the designers. \nThe packaging was designed to provide maximum \nshelf impact at retail and to showcase the compa-\nny’s signature colors. A bright green color is also \npart of the brand’s visual language for products.\nResults: Sales of Slice products continue to grow \nworldwide as more and more people appreciate \nthe brand’s design and functionality. Slice’s box \ncutter has not only won many prestigious awards \nfor its industrial design, but also has been recog-\nnized as a safer tool for the workplace. Slice’s \ninnovative use of ceramic blades has  \nattracted media attention from journalists at \nFinancial Times to Fast Company and Gizmodo. \nProduct categories have expanded to include \nkitchen, beauty care, home and office, and safety \nand industrial.\nSharpen!

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: Andy Sernovitz created \nthe Blog Council, later renamed the Social Media \nBusiness Council (SMBC), to create a safe envi-\nronment for social media decision makers at big \nbrands to share actionable ideas, best practices, \nand critical insights. Originally a sub-brand of \nGasPedal, the council grew and needed to be a \nstand-alone brand with its own website. There was \nsubstantial brand confusion, the acronym SMBC \nwas messy, and the name was hard to say. The \nname was changed to the more concise and \nmemorable SocialMedia.org. The organization also \nneeded a flexible system that would allow expan-\nsion into several councils, while maintaining \nequality among them. Matchstic was engaged to \ndesign a brand identity system and a new brand \narchitecture that would facilitate growth. After \ninterviewing the founder and conducting mar-\nketing and competitive audits, Matchstic attended \nBlogWell, a SocialMedia.org best practices confer-\nence, to interview existing members, nonmembers, \nand staff to gather insights. “People Like You” was \nthe positioning strategy Matchstic developed to \nunderscore that this was a brand-only community, \nfree of agencies and vendors, with a family of \n“people with the same jobs as you, facing the \nsame challenge as you.”\nCreative solution: Matchstic designed an \napproach called “the dot”—a circle that is the \nvessel for both the name and the newly acquired \ndomain. The brand mark serves as a signal of the \nbrand ideals of community, neutrality, and trust. \nMatchstic designed an identity system that reflects \nthe personality and communication style of the \norganization. Everything from the look and feel to \nthe voice is very straightforward yet personable. \nWhen a member joins, the company is assigned to \nan eighty-company council, which consists of 500 \nsocial media leaders selected from a wide range \nof industries. The brand architecture distinguishes \neach council with a color, such as the “Blue \nCouncil.” This conveys that they are all equal and \nthere is no preference or hierarchy. The “dot” is \nblack because black is a combination of all colors.\nResults: Since Socialmedia.org launched the new \nbrand, it has grown from 140 members to 214 and \nis preparing to launch its fourth council. Sernovitz \nsummarizes the results of the rebranding: “We’ve \nseen a substantial increase in credibility due to the \nnew brand. We now have the mature look that sig-\nnals that this is a substantial group with impact \nand longevity. Current members are more proud to \nshow their affiliation, and  \npotential members are much more responsive to \n our approach.”\nThis is one of the few forums \nwhere I have seen competitors \nwork together to help each \nother out.\nDan Phelps\nManager of Critical and  \nEmerging Communications\nT.

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: Spectrum Health was \nformed in 1997 by the merger of two competing \nGrand Rapids hospitals, followed by the acquisi-\ntion of seven additional hospitals and over 190 \nservice sites. Historically, names of entities were \nretained or altered slightly as they joined Spectrum \nHealth. Medical professionals and people in the \ncommunity continued to refer to entities by their \nold, familiar names. Like many rapidly growing \norganizations, Spectrum quickly outgrew its orig-\ninal visual identity and nomenclature structure. \nManagement recognized the need for a sophisti-\ncated and consistent system of identity and \nnomenclature to define and describe the organiza-\ntion, and to serve it through future decades of \nexpansion. In 2008, Crosby Associates began \nworking with the organization to develop a new \nvisual identity and an integrated branding program. \nThe process began with establishing a hierarchy \nof branded entities from administrative and organi-\nzational units, to departments and divisions, to \ncenters and institutes. Standards were also estab-\nlished for naming new acquisitions and alliances.\nCreative solution: Crosby designed a dynamic \nsymbol for the master brand that connotes energy \nand forward movement, and represents Spectrum \nHealth’s many components, services, and loca-\ntions. Along with a positioning strategy, the firm \ndeveloped a comprehensive system for \nsub-brands, typography, color, and formatting. \nStandards were developed for every structure and \nitem that represented the health system, including \nsignage, vehicles, stationery, print and electronic \ncommunications, gifts and gear, food service, uni-\nforms, and Microsoft Word-based templates for all \nsystem documents. Standards were then incorpo-\nrated into a password-protected website that can \nbe accessed by all internal communications teams \nand external vendors. All of these standards are \nnow integrated into the system’s official policies \nand procedures manual. After completing the \nstandards, Crosby continued to provide ongoing \nbrand consultation and supervision of the work of \noutside design firms and vendors.\nResults: Spectrum Health’s brand has contributed \nto its ability to attract top quality physicians and \nother health care professionals, and to be a \nleading choice for health care services providers in \nsearch of a merger partner. The visual identity and \nnomenclature standards facilitate a smooth inte-\ngration of acquired organizations. In 2011 and \n2010, Spectrum Health was named one of the \nnation’s top ten health systems by Thomson \nReuters. Spectrum Health continues to be the \nregion’s largest health care provider and West \nMichigan’s largest employer.\n295",

Bagels. After helping \nEinstein grow to 546 stores and doing a brief stint \nat Houlihan’s as the chief concept officer, Lozoff \nwas ready to be an entrepreneur again. She envi-\nsioned a fast, casual restaurant that served \nstone-­fire pizza—the kind made in Napoli in \nsouthern Italy. She wanted to change Americans’ \naffinity for beer and pizza to wine and pizza and \ncreate a Neapoli­tan experience. She believed in \nthe power of an integrated, collaborative creative \nteam to design a concept that takes shape in the \nprocess without a preconceived outcome. \nWilloughby was engaged to design the identity, \nenvironmental trade dress, packaging, and mer-\nchandise design; Tracy Stearns of 360 \nArchitecture was engaged to design the space. \nThe name SPIN! was inspired by the hand-­tossing \nof the pizza dough and Lozoff’s other passion, \nItalian bike racing.\nCreative solution: Everything about the SPIN! \nguest experience was designed to feel sponta-\nneous and unpredictable. Willoughby’s spin man \nlogo rides a bike while spinning a pizza. Every \naspect of the customer experience was designed \nto deliver a delightful, unforgettable brand experi-\nence. Details like the china, tableware, bike \nsprocket lights, and table surfaces were all consid-\nered and researched until the perfect object was \nfound. The team built models and designed the \ncustomer experience in numerous iterations \nending with full-­size prototypes of specific \nencounters in the guest journey. The large plates, \nfor example, are expensive, handmade ceramic \npottery but they are paired with typical restaurant \nutensils. The large-­scale identity graphics are \nmade of layered letterpress images of Italian bike \nraces and can be configured in a variety of ways \nso that each environment is a bit different. The \ngraphics are applied to unusual surfaces like \ncinder blocks and plywood. Willoughby worked \nwith Hammerpress and its founder, Brady Vest, to \ncreate a library of letterpress imagery derived from \nphotography, drawings, and vintage fonts.\nResults: The whole creative team attended early \ntastings and wine pairings. SPIN! did a soft launch \nwith family and friends for several weeks before \nopening. What started as one concept store in \nKansas City has grown to five in different neigh­\nborhoods. No two environments look the same. In \nevery location there are new elements, such as the \nscrap wood ceilings in SPIN! on Main Street. \nSPIN! has fostered healthier nutrition, community \ninvolvement, regional offerings, flex schedules, and \nservices.

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: With a fortieth anniversary \nfast approaching in 2011, Starbucks wanted to use \nthe milestone as an opportunity to clarify its future \nvision and refresh its customer experience and \nvisual expression. In early 2010, the Starbucks \nGlobal Creative Studio conducted a comprehen-\nsive brand, marketing, and strategy assessment, \nand began to identify the quintessential elements \nof the brand across touchpoints. Starbucks deter-\nmined through extensive strategic planning that its \nbrand needed the flexibility to explore product \ninnovation, become globally and regionally \nrelevant, and develop an evolved customer experi-\nence. Starbucks decided to free the Siren from the \nlogo and enable customers to make a more per-\nsonal connection with the brand. The internal \ncreative group explored hundreds of graphic alter-\nnatives for the Siren symbol, as well as size and \nrelationship alternatives for use with the Starbucks \n(Coffee) name, before arriving at the simple,  \nclean mark. \nThe Starbucks Global Creative Studio engaged \nLippincott to help refine brand elements, and to \nbring a cross-cultural perspective to building an \nintegrated, multi-platform system. Lippincott’s \nextensive global branding and implementation \nexperience would be valuable during the planning \nphase, and in building consensus within the global \ncorporation.\nCreative solution: Starbucks wanted the visual \nidentity system to say as much about its future as \nit did about its past, building on forty years of trust. \nLippincott examined how the positioning strategy \nwould work across marketing, retail environments \nand packaging, examining the hierarchy of  \nelements from the look and feel to the color,  \ntypography and use of patterns, photography, and \nillustration. Throughout the process, Lippincott \npartnered with the internal creative group to refine \nand define brand elements and character attri-\nbutes, develop implementation guidelines, and \nhelp build consensus among internal stakeholders. \nThe Siren is liberated from her ring and the iden-\ntity is free of words, with a vibrant green \nintroduced to signal the bright future ahead. \nResults: On Tuesday, March 8, 2011, Starbucks \nmarked its fortieth-year celebration. Starbucks \nbegan to roll out the new program to its 16,500 \nstores around the world, starting with the coffee \ncup. Chairman Howard Schultz’s video inspired \ncustomers from around the world to join in conver-\nsation about the Siren. This next evolution of the \nbrand has given Starbucks the freedom and flexi-\nbility to explore innovations and new channels of \ndistribution that will keep the company in step with \ncurrent customers while building strong connec-\ntions with new customers.\nFor forty years the Siren has \nbeen at the center of our \npassion for coffee.

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: The business partners \naspired to change the way Americans think about \nsushi, combining age-old Japanese craftsmanship \nwith a whole new dining experience. There are no \nfancy rolls or teriyaki—just unadulterated fresh \nseafood accented with the chef’s signature warm \nrice and homemade ponzu, simply presented. Jerry \nGreenberg and Clement Mok, designer and digital \npioneer, led the branding effort. The brand \npromise, “Surprisingly good food at a fair price \nthat’s quick and easy,” is the centerpiece of the \nnew business that builds on Chef Nozawa’s leg-\nendary status, and two decades of top Zagat \nratings for his restaurant in Studio City. The name \nSUGARFISH is a nod to Nozawa’s reputation for \n“melt in the mouth” sushi. The menu, while always \nchanging to reflect what’s fresh, has been dramati-\ncally simplified. Diners choose from three core \nselections, called Trust Me’s. It’s a prix-fixe menu \nwith tax and gratuities included­—no surprises on \nthe cost.\nCreative solution: Mok collaborated with archi-\ntect Glen Bell and the service staff to design and \nevolve all aspects of guests’ interaction and expe-\nrience, including restaurant interiors, scripts for the \nservers, menu, uniforms, media and promotion pro-\ngrams, signage, and social media initiatives. The \nsparkling, kaleidoscopic big eye tuna brandmark \nMok designed initially was supplemented with a \nsimplified, one-color version for the more modest \napplications, like menus and signage and the take-\nout bento box. When they realized the vibrant, \nbright colors of the original restaurant interiors \ndistracted guests from the food, interior designs \nfor the new locations incorporated more natural \nmaterials in their décor. Since quality and purity of \nthe ingredients are the cornerstones of the brand, \nit was important that marketing and promotion \nefforts reflect that same respect. Food is never \ndiscounted or part of any Groupon-like deals. \nPromotions are personal and the food experience \nshould be shared with friends, as in the free \nbirthday meal email.\nResults: Since opening, SUGARFISH has added \nfour new locations, earning rave reviews and a \nloyal following. Chef Nozawa’s son, Tom, and \nGreenberg are looking to expand the restaurant to \nother cities. The restaurant continues to build on \nNozawa’s mythical status and the uncompromising \nquality of his sushi. The prix-fixe menu and the \nsimplified selection have been a great success \nwith value-conscious, sushi-loving guests. \nLeveraging long-term relationships with the best \nJapanese importers and fish purveyors and elimi-\nnating the middleman to maximize quality and \ncontain costs has made this business model work. \nEach interaction and \ntouchpoint must \ncommunicate the brand \nspirit and serve to \nreinforce the food-centric \nnature of the brand \npromise.\nClement Mok\nHead of Marketing and Brand \nSUGARFISH\n301",

Tunerfish was first developed as an app \nthat helps people discover new shows and share \nwhat they are passionate about. Liquid Agency \nwas hired to develop the new company’s brand \nidentity. Liquid’s strategy and creative team from \ntheir offices in San Jose, California, and Santiago, \nChile, met with John McCrea, the founder, and his \nproduct design lead to clarify aspirations, goals, \nand business objectives. As the line between TV \nand the Internet continues to blur, Tunerfish was \nenvisioned as a company at the intersection of the \ntwo. “What should I watch right now?” is a question \nthat could be answered with TV shows, videos, \nand movies. Liquid believed that in order to dra-\nmatically differentiate Tunerfish from its \ncompetition, the design solution needed to be \nunexpected and emotive, with a lot of personality.\nCreative solution: After exploring many varia-\ntions on the idea of a fish, Liquid created a \ncharacter that was quirky, playful, and lovable.

Alfredo \nMuccino, chief creative director at Liquid, posed \nthe question, “What if the character changed into \ndifferent characters depending on the type of \nshow on TV and cinema (drama, comedy, action, \netc.)?” This breakthrough idea worked and the \nmasquerade began: the character holds a martini \nglass for Mad Men, sports fangs for the HBO \nseries True Blood, and wears a hat and cigar to \nsuggest the gangsters in Boardwalk Empire. \nThese icons are also part of the reward eco-\nsystem. The icon does cameo appearances to \nmake people chuckle; inspired by the 007 movies, \none fish introduces himself, “The name is Pond. \nJames Pond.”\nResults: Originally designed for the iPad, Tuner­\nfish is now available on the web and as an app  \nfor Android and iPhone. The company is working \nto bring it to all relevant platforms including  \nIP-­enabled TVs and set-­top boxes. Tunerfish is \nalso working closely with leaders in the most \nforward-­leaning companies in the entertainment \nbusiness, including HBO, Showtime, NBC (for \nDateline and Sunday Night Football) and E! to  \ncreate the best possible social TV experience.  \nThe brand launch attracted a lot of chatter, and \nsubscribers are growing at a handsome pace.\nTunerfish: Liquid Agency\n303",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: Kimberly-Clark, a leading \nconsumer products company, has been in the fem-\ninine care business for almost a century. Although \nhalf of the world’s population is female, it has \nnever been politically correct to talk about men-\nstruation, even with one’s family. Historically, the \nmarketing category has been very stagnant and \npredictable. Kimberly-Clark’s market share was \ndeclining, which jumpstarted a process to conduct \nextensive research, identify unmet needs, and find \nopportunities for innovation. The research revealed \nthat the target customers, whether they were \nteenage girls or mature women, were ready for \ntruth and transparency. They wanted to celebrate \ntheir individuality, and they were ready to take a \nsubject that was taboo and bring it out into the \nopen. “We pushed our team to think big and to \nthink differently,” said Jenn Bacon, director, Global \nDesign, Adult & Feminine Care Brands. The cen-\ntral positioning strategy that was developed was \nBreak the Cycle,* which meant that the Kotex \nbrand was ready to help women change the con-\nversation about their periods and vaginal care.\nCreative solution: The Feminine Care cross-\nfunctional teams began to design experiences to \ndrive customer affinity, and to create surprise, \nvariety, and delight on the shelf, on the web, and \nacross social networks, online advertising, and TV. \nBacon’s team envisioned a design strategy that \nwas inspired by cosmetics, beauty and fashion. \nThe brand segment targeted to 14- to 22-year-\nolds was renamed U by Kotex, and the tagline \nbecame  Break the Cycle.* Based on a funda-\nmental belief that good packaging should be \ndisruptive, the new exterior packaging was black, a \nradical leap in the feminine care category. The \nproduct itself, which for almost a century was \nwhite and light blue, is now wrapped in exuberant, \nelectric colors. The look and feel and attitude of \nthe packaging was aligned with the look, feel, and \nvoice of the website, Facebook, and Twitter. \nAcross social networks, the brand is encouraging \ngirls and women to speak out about their bodies \nand health, and to sign a Declaration of Real Talk.\nResults: Pushing the multidisciplinary teams to \nthink differently has had measurable results. The \ncompany that had the foresight to publish the first \nKotex Sanitary ad campaign in 1921 is leading a \ndifferent kind of revolution, bringing innovation to \nthe category, to its brand experience, and to its \ncustomers. The U by Kotex brand has begun to \nhelp women change the conversation about their \nbodies, periods, and vaginal care. As of August \n2012, over four million women have signed up \nonline to help Break the Cycle.*\nwww.ubykotex.com\nU by Kotex: Kimberly-Clark\n305",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: The idea for Unstuck \ncame from SYPartners, a transformation company \nthat helps CEOs and their leadership teams  \nduring moments of change. Having worked with \nleaders at companies such as IBM, Starbucks, \nFacebook, and GE, SYPartners wanted to bring  \nits methods to an individual audience. With the \nintroduction of the Apple iPad, the company finally \nfelt it had found the right medium to create a \ntactile, engaging, and (most importantly) human-­\ncentered system that could serve as the first \nUnstuck offering.\nA core team of four people with skills across \nstrategy, product design, project management, and \nproduct development used three key design prin-\nciples to guide the creation of both the brand and \nthe app: It had to be smart but accessible, it had  \nto inspire action, and it had to be empathetic and \naspirational. The team also took inspiration from \ngaming and did extensive research into traditional  \ntherapeutic techniques. Trial and error and user \ntesting helped the team stay on track and in tune \nwith the user base throughout development.\nCreative solution: There are three distinct but \nseamless sections to the app’s flow: figuring out \nhow you’re stuck, learning how to get unstuck,  \nand taking action. Each is infused with candor, wit, \ninformation, and a sense of fun, all of which mask \nthe complex technical underpinnings that make \nthe app effective.\nFrom the user’s perspective, section one consists \nof several multiple-­choice questions asked in an \nengaging, gamelike way. On the back-end, an \nalgorithm based on human behavior patterns dic-\ntates the choices presented to each person, \ndepending on his or her previous answers. \nSimilarly, the prescriptions in section two (how to \nget unstuck) spring from a simple yet encom-\npassing idea that stuck moments result from a gap \nin seeing, believing, thinking, or acting. And in the \nthird section—the tools that help you take action—\nboth the process and the summary screen give \nthe user continual payoff via thought-­provoking \nexercises and presentation. The final takeaway for \nany user: Personalized insight that is actionable in \nreal life.\nResults: Unstuck launched in December 2011, \nand a small team handled everything, from mar-\nketing, public relations, customer service, and \nsocial media to technical bug fixes. The team \ntapped media relationships to get an initial round \nof coverage, listened to what users and reviewers \nwere saying, and spread the word. Unstuck \nreceived coverage from a number of outlets, \nincluding the New Yorker, Oprah.com, TechCrunch, \nLifehacker, and Fast Company. Ultimately, iTunes \nuser reviews determined success, and with a 4.5-­\nstar rating, the download rate continued to grow.\nUnstuck thinking has always gone beyond a single \nproduct. The goal is to broaden and deepen its  \nofferings as well as evolve community interactions. \nUnstuck: SYPartners\n307",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: Vueling began as an  \nidea for the first budget airline that would compete \nnationally in Spain and southern Europe from a \nhub in Barcelona. Public opinion of the low-­cost \nairline category was characterized by disappoint-\nment, mistrust, and mixed feelings. Conceived \njointly by founder Carlos Muñoz and Saffron Brand \nConsultants, the challenge was to reinvent the  \ncategory and prove that cheap flights didn’t have \nto mean lower standards of service, comfort, and \nstyle. Saffron began by creating the name. In \nSpain, Spanglish is hip. In Spanish, vuela means  \nto fly, ergo, Vueling. The URL was available—vital \nfor a service that sells mostly online. Saffron pro-\nceeded to design a new experience for customers: \ndirect, simple, unexpected, and down-to-earth with \nlow prices and great service. All brand expressions \nwould embody espíritu Vueling, doing things the \nVueling way. Online transactions would be as  \neasy as one, two, three. New planes, not old, would \nfly from major, not secondary, airports.\nCreative solution: Saffron created the name and \nan entire identity system—not only visual and \nverbal but also behavioral—from nose to tail, from \nstaff-­customer contact to online interface to music \nand menu planning. Straightforward and fast for-\nward, espíritu Vueling inspired all customer \ntouchpoints to feel fresh, cosmopolitan, and cool. \nVoice was first. Saffron engineered a cultural shift \nfrom formal to informal. All brand communications \nspeak informally by using tu, not usted. Airbus \neven had to rewrite the onboard signage for \nVueling’s planes. From the beginning, Saffron and \nVueling management agreed that as a service \nbrand, the people are paramount. The identity \nwork informed the airline’s HR policies, and has \nbeen reinforced subsequently by leading many \nemployee training sessions. After the core brand \nengagement was complete, Saffron continued  \nto keep espíritu Vueling alive through training, and \nworking on their brand committee.\nResults: At launch, Vueling achieved the highest \ncapitalization to date by a new airline in Europe.  \nIt reached its full-­year revenue target of 21 million \neuros within the first six months. In less than a \nyear, Vueling had carried more than 1.2 million \npassengers on twenty-two routes between four-\nteen cities. In 2008, Vueling announced it would \nmerge with Clickair, another low-­cost airline that is \n80 percent owned by flag carrier Iberia. The  \ndecision to name the merged company Vueling \nwas supported by surveys that confirmed the \nsuperior strength of the brand among customers \nand employees. \nVueling was successful \nfrom its start because it \nhad been made by a \ngroup of dreamers,  \nwho dreamed about \nstarting an airline that \npeople in southwest \nEurope needed and \nactually liked.\nFrom day one, the public \nappreciated the full \nexperience of efficiency, \ncare for client, and \nenthusiasm by its staff. \nHard work and learning, \nincluding apologizing  \nto clients for mistakes, \ndid the rest.\nCarlos Muñoz\nFounder\nVueling\n309",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: Ann Willoughby had \nalways dreamed of owning a barn that would be a \nplace for innovation and collaboration. Her design \nand brand experience firm in Kansas City, \nMissouri, is thirty-three miles south of her one-\nhundred-­acre working farm, named Bountiful after \nthe 1985 film, A Trip to Bountiful. In 1997, \nWilloughby commissioned a young architect, Dan \nMaginn, who had just founded a new firm, El \nDorado Architects, to design the barn. This would \nbe their first building. The barn was a three-­year \ncollaborative journey between Dan and Ann, a \nliving dialogue about place making, sustainability, \nand design. Siting the structure was challenging; \nits location needed to be close to the old farm-\nhouse, and needed to take advantage of favorable \nbreezes from a nearby wooded ravine. There are \nforests and cropland, a series of tributaries that \nrun into Bee Creek, and red hawks, quail, and wild \nturkeys wander freely.\nCreative solution: Willoughby knew that for the \nbarn to be a place where transformative experi-\nences happened, it must have soaring, light-­filled \nspaces. As an event space, it needed to be flexible \nand accommodate leadership retreats, confer-\nences, and storytelling. The design solution is \nfiercely modern; the one-­of-­a-kind copper barn  \nrespects the land and the farm, and works at a \nvery personal scale. The architects preserved the \nhistory of a Midwestern farm structure, and inte-\ngrated modern amenities like natural glass barn \ndoors that open up to the landscape and a full  \nindustrial kitchen. Fifty-­six percent of the materials \ncame from recycled and reclaimed materials.  \nThe century-­old timber posts and beams were  \nsalvaged from a crumbling barn in Highland, \nMississippi. Ann and Dan selected materials that \nwould age and patinate naturally, such as corru-\ngated copper, reclaimed pine boards, oak flooring, \nand cypress trim. The floors were salvaged from  \na grade school gymnasium.\nResults: In 2004, El Dorado Architects won  \nthe AIA Award of Excellence for the Willoughby \nDesign Barn in the Central States Region. The  \njury was impressed with the barn’s simplicity, utility, \nand elegance, and the thoughtful use of materials. \nOver the last decade, business leaders, designers, \nentrepreneurs, scientists, and leadership and \nbranding teams have come to the barn to reflect \nand revitalize their vision for the future. The barn \nhas been a venue for Willoughby clients, inno­\nvation conferences, and most recently a brand \nboot camp for twenty-six entrepreneurial founders  \nfrom Kauffman Labs.\nWilloughby Design Barn: ElDorado Architects\n311",

    "chunk_full": "Process and strategy: The National Center  \nfor Family Literacy (NCFL) wanted a new way to \nengage families and educators in learning that \nwould broaden their reach. The NCFL retained \nBrains on Fire to reimagine what could be a game-­\nchanger in literacy improvement efforts. Brains  \non Fire embarked on a nationwide insight tour to \ntalk with single, working-­class, and immigrant par-\nents about how they engage in learning with their \nchildren. From the heartland of Ohio to New York \nand Los Angeles, they found that parents and \nedu­cators were not seeking resources on how to \ninstruct their children. Instead, they needed a free \nand easy way to inspire them. Rather than building \na website strictly about how to encourage literacy, \nBrains on Fire and NCFL envisioned a place and \nan experience that nurtured the sense of wonder \ninside everyone. Reframing the conversation \naround literacy could begin with a simple idea—\nstart with curiosity and learning, and literacy will \nfollow; start with questions, not answers.\nCreative solution: The name, Wonderopolis,  \nwas created by Brains on Fire to convey a magical \nplace where wonder and learning are nurtured \nthrough the power of discovery, creativity, and \nimagination. Wonderopolis.org is an online \nresource that provides fresh and relevant content \nthat engages families and educators, and works \nwithin the reality of modern family life. Every day, \nkids are offered a new Wonder of the Day,  \ninspired by the kinds of things that kids naturally \nwonder about, from “Why are flamingos pink?” \n(Wonder #1) to “How hot is the sun?” (Wonder \n#332). Bite-­sized pieces of information along  \nwith pictures and video are ideal for busy families. \nWonderopolis.org was launched in October  \n2010 to ignite a conversation by engaging users in \na two-­way dialogue online, on Facebook and \nTwitter. Building on these core ideas, a pilot pro-\ngram called Camp What-­a-­Wonder was developed  \nto specifically address the goal of engaging  \nkids and families in daily learning during the \nsummer months.\nResults: In its first month, Wonderopolis attracted \nover 18,500 visitors, and the number of monthly \nunique visitors grew by 670 percent in the first \neight months. There was a limited budget for mar-\nketing and PR, and growth was fueled mostly by \npeople sharing Wonderopolis organically on \nTwitter and Facebook.

A \nbrand consultant and coach, she describes \nher work as strategic imagination. Her passion \nis brand identity: how organizations express \nwho they are and what they stand for. Over her \ncareer, she has worked with large enterprises, \nentrepreneurial ventures, and nonprofits. Her \nmantra is, “Who are you? Who needs to know? \nWhy should they care? How will they find out?” \nHer one-day Speed of Light workshops review \nthe branding tools and fundamentals, five-\nphase process, and best practices featured in \nDesigning Brand Identity. Whether meeting with \nthe leadership team, the board of directors, \nor the design team, she brings high energy, \nempathy, and insights to her simple and \nactionable solutions and strategies.\nIn Wheeler’s intensive Inside/Outside brand \nlabs, she works with multidisciplinary teams to \nsolve complex branding problems. She engages \norganizations in a rigorous and collaborative \nprocess to achieve remarkable results, build \ntrust, and transcend silos. She inspires branding \nteams to seize every opportunity to design \ncompelling customer experiences, touchpoint  \nby touchpoint. \nIn addition to authoring four editions of \nDesigning Brand Identity, Wheeler collaborated \nwith information designer Joel Katz on Brand \nAtlas: Branding Intelligence Made Visible (Wiley), \na radical reinvention of a business book that \nuses provocative diagrams and minimal text to \ncommunicate about marketplace dynamics and \nbrand fundamentals.\nWhen not on the road, Wheeler works in her \nbrand laboratory in Philadelphia, or in Keene \nValley, an Adirondack hamlet. She and her \nphotographer husband, Ed, love to hike, make \nart, and laugh a lot. They have been married \nsince 1977, and have two daughters and  \ntwo grandsons.\nFor consulting engagments  \nand speaking inquiries: \nalina@alinawheeler.com\nFor comments or inquiries about \nDesigning Brand Identity:  \nauthor@alinawheeler.com\n@alinawheeler",

    "chunk_full": "Introduction\nThe two most common questions I get when I’m\nsitting on a panel or giving a talk about crowdfunding\nare “How do you do it?” and “How can I do it too?”\nNo one wants to hear statistics, theories, or one-size-\nfits-all advice, and I don’t blame them. People want\nreal guidance, real stories from the trenches, and real\ntakeaways. People have ideas—whether it’s a brilliant\nnew tech product, a powerful documentary, or a\ngorgeous piece of design—and they want to know\nhow to capture the attention of the crowd and\nconvince complete strangers to fund their dreams.\nI’ve raised over $20 million (and counting) for\nclients’ crowdfunding campaigns around the world,\nand I have a lot to share. My clients pay me a\nconsiderable amount of money for my guidance and\nexpertise, but I’m giving away all my best advice in\nthese pages. Why? Well, crowdfunding has given me\na lot—my career, my company, my sense of purpose,\nand the amazing experience of an entire community\ngetting behind what you’re doing. I love the\negalitarianism of crowdfunding—I love that it’s\navailable to all, and not just the privileged few. I want\nto give back to the crowdfunding community that has\ngiven me so much. That’s why I’m here. So hi!",

    "chunk_full": "Welcome. Let’s get started.\nSince I first started managing crowdfunding\ncampaigns as a freelancer in 2012, and after launching\nmy company, Vann Alexandra, in 2014, I’ve worked on\nan incredible range of projects. I spent my early days\nfunding documentaries, and now I’ve grown a\nbusiness that runs major campaigns of all kinds\naround the world.\nSo here’s how it works: Clients come to us with an\nidea, and we build and manage the entire\ncrowdfunding campaign for them from beginning to\nend—from copywriting, pitching press, developing an\ninfluencer strategy, and managing the video\nproduction to donor engagement, design strategy,\nmessaging, email marketing, and all the day-to-day\ncommunication and handling of ongoing details. Some\nof my projects involve big names—Dr. Maya Angelou,\nTLC, Neil Young, Joan Didion—while many others\ncome from everyday people with great ideas. One of\nmy recent campaigns was to reissue an out-of-print\nNASA Graphics Standards Manual by two\ntwentysomething graphic designers. It raised just shy\nof $1 million.\nI’m here to tell you with complete confidence that\nthere are thousands of people out there who are\neager to put money toward projects they believe in. In\n2015 alone, the global rewards and donation-based\ncrowdfunding industry helped generate a staggering",

The harsh reality is that\nthe majority of crowdfunding campaigns fail. Just look\nat one of the most successful rewards-based\ncrowdfunding platforms in the world, Kickstarter. As I\nwrite this, there are more than 4,000 live campaigns;\nstatistically less than 40 percent of them are likely to\nmeet their goals. And recent research reveals that\nthose success rates will continue to decline as the\nmarket grows. Plus, failing on Kickstarter means\nfailing hard—if you fall short of your goal by the\ndeadline, you won’t see any of the money you’ve\nraised, and you might actually tarnish your shiny idea.\nLaunching a crowdfunding campaign is very public. If\nit fails, your backers might be gun-shy about giving\nyou another chance.\nThe truth is, if you want to fund your idea, you’ll\nneed to be prepared to invest blood, sweat, tears,\nhundreds of hours, and a ton of strategizing to ensure\nyour campaign succeeds.\nThe good news is this: if I can be successful at\ncrowdfunding, so can you. These days, I’m known as\nThe Crowdsourceress because of my extremely high\nsuccess rate—I have some of the most successful\n(and some of the most famous) campaigns under my\nbelt. But back when I first started, I was pretty much\nclueless. The first time someone asked me to help\nwith a project, I had to Google “Kickstarter” to find",

In my case, it\nwas a little bit of each.\nI grew up in Miami in the ’80s and ’90s. My dad\nowned a company that created anti–money laundering\nsoftware for banks and financial institutions, and my\nmom owned a company that did marketing for radio\nand television stations. I remember going to my\nmom’s office almost every day after school with my\nolder brother and doing my homework in the\nconference room, surrounded by ringing phones,\nmeetings in progress, and the controlled chaos of\npeople working hard toward production deadlines.\nLooking back, I know I absorbed some of my parents’\nentrepreneurial drive. It’s worth noting that I am\nextremely lucky to have had the opportunity to learn\nfrom my parents. Not everyone gets that chance.\nUltimately, what I really learned from my parents was\nthe value of hard work. When my parents met, they\nhad nothing; they built their companies from scratch.\nA big part of running a successful business is the\nhead-down work involved—also a critical component\nof a successful crowdfunding campaign.",

    "chunk_full": "CROWDFUNDING 101\nFirst things first: in rewards-based crowdfunding,\nproject creators raise money for projects through\nonline pledges from backers, and in return, backers\nget a reward. For example, in the film category, a\nreward might be a copy of the film, a poster, dinner\nwith the director, or a name in the credits. What’s\nreally fascinating about rewards-based crowdfunding\nis that backers are essentially donating to a project,\nnot investing in it. In the case of many crowdfunding\ncampaigns—like the ones that raise money for film\nediting—backers are pledging to help make your\nproject happen, not necessarily to place an order on a\nproduct.\nTwo widely used rewards-based crowdfunding\nplatforms are Kickstarter and Indiegogo, where\ncreators set a monetary goal to reach within a limited\nperiod of time (for example, 30, 45, or 60 days). A\ncritical difference between Kickstarter and Indiegogo\nis that funding on Kickstarter is always all-or-nothing. If\na creator raises only $49,000 toward a $50,000 goal\non Kickstarter, they get nothing. On the other hand, on\nIndiegogo, creators can run a campaign with an all-or-\nnothing “fixed” model or with flexible funding.\nFlexible funding means creators keep the money they\nraise, even if they don’t hit their target.",

But don’t get hung up on language! Each\npair of terms basically means the same thing.\nWhen clients come to me asking which platform to\nuse, I tell them it’s really up to them to determine\nwhich one they are most comfortable with. Both\nplatforms can lead you to success, but if you’re\ndeciding between Indiegogo and Kickstarter, and you\nknow you need the flexible funding option, Indiegogo\nis your only option.

As the\ncampaign progressed, Tim also released updates to\nbackers through Kickstarter. Instead of writing generic\nmessages, like “We’re doing great! Keep spreading\nthe word!” Tim shared new, fun, useful content, like\nvideos where he’d update backers about rewards and\npress coverage, and exclusive videos from the WFMU\narchives.

Without the WFMU listeners, I\ndon’t know if we could have made it to the finish line.\nThe number one thing I learned in my first\ncrowdfunding campaign is the power of the fan base\n—the built-in audience.\nA built-in audience is the most motivated,\nenthusiastic segment of your “crowd.” They are the\npeople who make your project a success.

I find that\npotential donors will assume that if your video is low\nquality, your product will probably be low quality too.\nShow the world that you put care and time into the\nwork you do. Rent the right equipment, or even\nbetter, hire a professional—because, let’s be real, you\nmight not even know how to use that equipment by\nyourself. If you have no cash up front, try to get\ncreative. Do a trade with a filmmaker friend. You\nmight be able to work out a deal where you can pay\nthem upon success of the campaign.\nIn a post I wrote for CNBC, Hamish Smyth—our\ndesign director and my frequent collaborator—nailed\nthe importance of a well-produced video when he\nsaid, “It is no longer good enough to skimp on\nproduction and put something out there half-baked.

After that, you can use your project\npage to further explain any details or technical aspects\nabout your project or product—in another video, in\ntext, and/or in visual form.

Since then, I’ve partnered\nwith them on some hugely successful crowdfunding\nprojects, and I am always blown away and inspired by\ntheir work. So I asked them for their thoughts on\nmaking a successful crowdfunding video.\nFirst, we talked about some of the challenges. You\ncan probably guess one of the hardest things about\nmaking a crowdfunding video: fitting it all in! You have\nto take something that’s complex and has a lot of\nparts and boil it down to a video that’s short, powerful,\nand has a strong message. (That’s why it’s so\nimportant to write out a script and get feedback on it.)\nRAVA also pointed out that while the call-to-action\nof the campaign is to get pledges, that shouldn’t be\nthe focus of the film.

The\nvideo introduces you and your campaign to a new\naudience. It’s a lot different from traditional\nadvertising, where you’re usually talking to a seasoned\naudience. (Think about how many times you’ve seen a\nCoke ad, for example.) With crowdfunding, you’re\ntypically initiating a new relationship with a new\naudience. “That’s why you have to think so much\nabout how you’re building an identity,” RAVA says.\n“You’re not just making a video, you’re creating a\nbrand image around the project. The video, and the\nwhole campaign, is an exercise in branding.” (We will\ngo deeper into this in chapter 4.)\nThis might seem obvious, but RAVA says to avoid\nclosely mimicking other campaigns. “Sometimes\npeople think there’s a magic formula and if you\nreplicate the same video or the same idea that worked\nfor another campaign, then you also will succeed,”\nRAVA points out. But every company or project has to\nfind its own language and messaging.\nWhen it comes to actually making the video, RAVA\ntoo suggests trying to achieve as much production\nquality as possible. If you have a limited budget, a DIY\nvideo is an option, but not everyone can pull it off.

Consumers are far more excited\nand engaged in what you’re trying to do\nbecause they recognize it’s not a pre-order\nstore. With crowdfunding, after I make a\npledge, the first thing I’m prompted to do\nis share—which is a totally different\npsychology compared to buying an item\nanywhere else. That call-to-action results\nin a significantly higher amount of organic\ntraffic and evangelism for a product. The\nconcept of crowdfunding itself is driven by\nsocial shares and virality. It means you\nhave a potential to reach a much bigger\naudience.\nI couldn’t agree more. In my experience, there",

The\nconcept is simple: successful campaigns are the result\nof having a crowd that will fund you. Your friends and\nfamily are, in most cases, not a big enough crowd. To\naccess a bigger crowd, you have to get more eyes on\nyour project, and reaching people through press\ncoverage and social media are two fundamental and\nhighly effective ways of doing that. Plus, this part of\ncrowdfunding can be incredibly fun. It’s a chance to be\ncreative, think outside the box, expand your network,\nand build your community.",

Once a campaign is\ncomplete, creators can upload a large banner image\nand post updates that appear in a detailed timeline.\nThe “Back This Project” button can be updated to\ndirect new visitors to a creator’s website, where\npeople can learn more about the project or business,\nsign up for a mailing list, or—hopefully—make an\norder. As if you don’t have enough stuff to do during\nthe campaign, it’s ideal to have a website with an\nonline store ready right when the campaign is over, so\nvisitors have a place to go to if they missed the\ncampaign. Still, be mindful of what you promised your\ncrowdfunding backers. If you said, for example, the\nreward levels will be exclusive to the crowdfunding\ncampaign, the post-campaign website should have\nhigher price points.\nAfter the Standards Manual campaigns, Hamish and\nJesse took advantage of the Spotlight feature by using\nit to direct people to their own online store, which\nthey created with Shopify, an e-commerce platform.\nFor the NYCTA manual, they worked out a new\nagreement with the MTA that allowed them to sell a\nsmaller, compact version of the book without the\nessay and some of the fancy production values.

Even as I launched my second\nand third campaigns, I still felt like I was running\naround in the dark, trying to cling to strategies that\nworked and throwing out ones that didn’t.\nLess than two years after I helped raise $80,000 for\nSex and Broadcasting, I helped smash an $800,000\ngoal within 24 hours for Neil Young’s PonoPlayer\ncampaign. It was clear that this wasn’t just my\npersonal experience; crowdfunding was a fast-moving\nfinancial movement. As I write this in 2016, more than\n$1 billion has been raised on Indiegogo, and about\n$2.8 billion has been pledged to Kickstarter projects.\nThe growth across the crowdfunding space is almost\nunbelievable.\nI spoke with Evan Cohen, the former senior director\nof design, technology, and hardware at Indiegogo,\nabout how crowdfunding has changed since its\ninception. Evan explained how he thinks about the\nevolution of crowdfunding in two stages: In the early\nera of crowdfunding, between 2008 and 2013, most\ncampaigns were run by one person or a small team\nthat needed to raise money to take a project from\npoint A to point B; they needed a little money to keep\nsomething going—to finish editing a film, for example.\n“But around late 2012 and early 2013,” Evan said,",

How you communicate\nwith clients and everyone around you is vital. I\nremember during the first summer we were dating,\nHamish had a day off from work and he came to my\noffice to help out. He looked at what I drafted for our\nclient kit and then I watched as he crossed out\nsentence after sentence. “Cut all this out,” he said.\n“These buzzwords don’t mean anything.” (I was using\nwords like “curate” a lot.) He told me about the book\nWriting That Works: How to Communicate Effectively\nin Business by Kenneth Roman and Joel Raphaelson. I\ngot a copy, and it completely revolutionized how I\nwrite and communicate with clients. Now, I keep\nemails and pitches to a few sentences. I make sure\ncampaign pages are easy to understand. I focus on\nsaying what I mean clearly and directly, avoiding\njargon. (Yes, I know I use the word “influencers” a ton\nin this book. Sometimes industry terminology is",

But I quickly realized that it made more\nsense to work on a commission, where I earned part\nof the total amount I helped my clients crowdfund.\nWith time, I started working on more extensive\nprojects, hitting higher goals for bigger projects. I\nbegan asking for a retainer up front, along with a\ncommission based on the final goal and the scope of\nthe work my team would be doing. Now I mostly work\non retainer with a bonus fee structure.\nIt’s so hard to raise your rates. I have found that,\nespecially as a woman, it’s tough to speak up. For a\nlong time, I suffered from imposter syndrome where\nyou think that your success is just luck or an accident,\nnot the result of your knowledge and abilities. That\nmade it tough for me to ask for more money. But you\nneed to believe that you are valuable. We recently\nraised our rates, and I learned to gauge how people\nreact. Hamish gave me this great piece of advice,\nparaphrased from an article by designer Jessica\nHische: If clients accept your rates immediately, you\nshould have charged more. If they negotiate, often\nyou can work out the right price. And if they say the\nquote is too high, you can decide if you should work\nwithin their budget, or walk away.

    "chunk_full": "MISTAKES AND FAILURE: LEARN AND MOVE\nFORWARD\nRecently, I ran a crowdfunding campaign that didn’t\nmeet its goal. Despite our best efforts, the project\nnever gained traction. On top of that, it even got\ncriticized and received a lot of negative commentary\nonline. When it failed, I lost the 100 percent success\nrate I’d publicly maintained throughout my\ncrowdfunding career. I had to face the reality that\nkeeping up that success rate wasn’t sustainable.\nNobody can bat a thousand, and there’s no such thing\nas perfection in crowdfunding or business (or anything\nin life). In the end, what I was proud of is that I stood\nby my client’s side all the way to the day the\ncampaign officially failed. I learned that success\ndoesn’t come just from projects that make money; it\ncomes from working on projects I believe in and\nmaintaining loyalty to the clients I have the privilege of\nworking with.\nA big lesson in running a startup is learning how to\nrecover from rough times, too. Very occasionally we\nwork with a client who’s not a great fit for us. I won’t\ngo into too much detail here, but after trying and\nfailing to find ways to collaborate with a particular\nclient, we had to part ways and it felt terrible. But I\nknew my team and I needed to stay positive and\nmove forward right away. Together we made\nmargaritas in the office and said “cheers” to the next",

It feels so\nreassuring and empowering to know that it’s not just\nme who’s invested in this work; I have a team who’s\ninvested, too.\nIt’s incredible knowing my team is with me along\nthe way, especially because one of the hardest things\nabout the startup world is dealing with turnover. It’s a\nhuge challenge to find the right fit, and training new\nhires is a big investment.\nSo I’ve also had to learn how to effectively manage\npeople, create structure, and bring out the best in\neverybody. In the beginning, I remember a day where\nI got really frustrated with one of my staff members\nafter catching a series of mistakes. I expected him/her\nto know everything from how to talk to a client to how\nto format an email. Then I realized I was being\nimpatient and unrealistic. We’re a small business, and\nwe don’t have a formal training program; everyone is\nlearning on the job and doing their best. But I could\nalso do more to support my team and to formalize and\nteach standard processes. That’s when I created our\nemployee handbook, which details everything from\nhow we run campaigns to how to log vacation time.\nNow, we have weekly team meetings. Also, at the\nend of each day we email each other what we plan to\nwork on the following day—what we call “priority",

There’s nothing to be sorry about; I just want\nto know that they’ve learned from it.\nAnd then there are client relationships.\nCrowdfunding is stressful, and part of our job is\nhelping clients navigate through that stress—while\ntrying not to become stressed ourselves. I really care\nabout what I do, and when I work on a new campaign,\nI treat it like my own project. That’s part of what I love\nabout my job: I’m good at connecting with people and\ntheir passions on an emotional level.

At one point, after a string of\ntough campaigns and clients, and suffering from\nserious burnout, I had to take a step back and evaluate\nwhat was working and what wasn’t working.\nSometimes you just have to tell yourself you’re not\nsaving lives and remind yourself that this is a job.\nAs a business owner, I face a lot of the same\nchallenges anyone else does in trying to earn a living,\nmake a difference, and feel happy and balanced at the\nend of the day.
